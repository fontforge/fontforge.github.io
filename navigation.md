Header navigation
=================

The navigation underneath the logo should consist of:

- Download
- Install
- Features
- Documentation
- Volunteer

Volunteer could be removed for simplicity. It'll be on the footer navigation anyway. It could also be called "Helping out" rather than "Volunteer". :)
"Documentation" here should bring you to a page similar to the current overview.html, but with some quick links to the most common things emphasized at the top.
