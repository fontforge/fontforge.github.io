<P>
Ironically, FontForge is stuck in the dark ages when it comes to using fonts.
It should be using libXft and gtk to get full unicode support.
<P>
It doesn't. It continues to use the old X bitmap interface which the X consortium
isn't interested in extending beyond BMP (since libXft/gtk do this well and
there is no point in redoing that for an obsolete interface).
<P>
But I'd like to draw non-BMP characters at least in my font view.
<P>
To this end I have made FontForge recognize some non-standard encodings:
-*-*-*-*-*--*-*-*-*-*-*-UnicodePlane-{1,2,3,...16}

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Is a font that fontforge will interpret as containing glyphs from plane 1
(Supplementary Multilingual Plane) -- starting with Linear B glyphs.
<P>
As a proof of concept I've created a bdf font containing all the Linear B
syllables, and not much of anything else (I am aware that the CODE200? fonts
provide good glyphs for the non-bmp characters, but they are shareware so
I can't just rasterize them and redistribute them).
<P>
If anyone would like to submit glyphs to this font (or to putative similar
ones for planes 2&amp;14) I'll try and coordinate that process.

<P>
The sfd file is encoded with a "full unicode" encoding. The program toplane.c
will take a bdf containing one Unicode plane, figure out which plane it is,
and reencode the font with the appropriate UnicodePlane mapping.
