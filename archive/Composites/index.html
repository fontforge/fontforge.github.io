  TrueType composites: Apple &amp; MicroSoft differences
</H1>
<P>
Apple and Microsoft rasterizers interpret some truetype composites differently
and this can result in radically different displays of a character. Here
is a character designed to be displayed on a Mac, the composite consists
of two components, one of which has been rotated and scaled. If Apple's
definition of composite behavior is followed then the two strokes will just
barely touch at the left edge. If MicroSoft's is followed then the diagonal
stroke will be offset from the vertical by a considerable amount.

<P>
On the right is a dump (using microsoft's
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/tools/tools.htm">ttfdump</A>
program) of the corresponding glyph. As you can see it consists of two
components, the first has been scaled by 1.5 and then rotated 45&#176;, its
horizontal offset is 810. The other is neither rotated nor scaled and its
horizontal offset is 1156.
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6glyf.html">According
to Apple</A> the first component should have its offset scaled by 1.5 (yielding
an offset of 1215 which is just enough for the two glyphs to kiss).
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/opentype/glyf.html">According
to MicroSoft </A>the offset is not scaled.
<P>
This problem only arises if a composite is scaled (actually: has a transformation
matrix whose determinant is not 1, so skewing is also an issue but rotating
and flipping are not), so it is fairly rare.
<P>
The OpenType spec now provides two bits (in the composite flags array) to
disambiguate this case (neither bit is set in the above example, hence the
problem). If bit 0x800 is set then the rasterizer should use Apple's definition,
while if bit 0x1000 is set MicroSoft's (and now OpenType's default) definition.
If neither bit is set then the platform's default will be used. Apple does
not document these bits on their site, but they do support them (At least
in Mac OS/9 and Mac OS/X). On the other hand, MicroSoft does document the
bits, but the rasterizer on my Win/Me box does not support Apple's rules.
<P>
Apple documents a moderately complex algorithm for determining the factor
by which each offset should be scaled. This algorithm does not match the
behavior of Apple's rasterizer under Mac OS/9 and Mac OS/X. I have determined
empirically that the proper scaling factors are:<BR CLEAR=Right>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; horizontalScale = sqrt(XScale*XScale +
Scale01*Scale01)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; verticalScale &nbsp; = sqrt(YScale*YScale +
Scale10*Scale10)</CODE><BR>
(using the same notation as ttfdump). Basically, this means that the horizontal
scale factor is the length of the vector that results from applying the
transformation matrix to (1,0).

<P>
Here is a collection of the permutations of a font which displays the problem.
The characters B-L contain scaled or rotated or flipped components. They
also contain another component to show where the transformed component should
line up if Apple's rules are followed (as in the example at the top of the
page, which may be found at "F").

add the OpenType bit to the flags array).
