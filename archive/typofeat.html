These dialogs manipulate features which already exist. See the
<A HREF="fontinfo.html#Contextual">Element-&gt;Font Info</A> and
<A HREF="charinfo.html#features">Element-&gt;Char Info</A> dialogs for
information on how to create these features in the first place.

  <IMG SRC="/assets/img/old/copyfeatures.png" WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="503" ALT="Copy Feature(s) to Font dialog"
      ALIGN="Right"><A NAME="Copy-Feat">Copy Feature(s) to Font...</A>
</H2>
<P>
This dialog allows you to copy a feature or related set of features from
one font to another. You may select the feature by specifying its opentype
tag (or apple feature/setting), the scripts and languages to which it applies,
and its flags.
<P>
If you leave the Tag field blank then it will match any tag. Similarly you
may select either a specific set of scripts and languages or "Any Script".
And a specific set of flags, or Any flags.
<P>
Finally you must select the font (or fonts) to which you wish the information
copied.
<P>
When copying contextual/chaining dialogs or apple statemachines this will
also copy any nested lookups on which these features depend.
<P>
(This does not copy kerning information)<BR CLEAR=ALL>

  <IMG SRC="/assets/img/old/removefeature.png" WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="344" ALT="Remove Feature(s) dialog"
      ALIGN="Right"><A NAME="Rm-Feat">Remove Feature(s)...</A>
</H2>
<P>
This dialog allows you to remove a feature or related set of features from
a font. You may select the feature by specifying its opentype tag (or apple
feature/setting), the scripts and languages to which it applies, and its
flags.
<P>
If you leave the Tag field blank then it will match any tag. Similarly you
may select either a specific set of scripts and languages or "Any Script".
And a specific set of flags, or Any flags.
<P>
The example at right will remove all common ligatures that apply to the latin
script (to the French and default languages) with no flags set.
<P>
(This does not remove kerning information)<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<H2>
  <IMG SRC="/assets/img/old/retagfeature.png" ALT="Retag Feature(s) dialog" ALIGN="Right" WIDTH="282"
      HEIGHT="621"><A NAME="Retag-Feat">Retag Feature(s)...</A>
</H2>
<P>
This dialog allows you to give a feature (or related set of features) a new
opentype tag (or new apple feature/setting). You may select the feature by
specifying its opentype tag (or apple feature/setting), the scripts and languages
to which it applies, and its flags.
<P>
If you leave the Tag field blank then it will match any tag. Similarly you
may select either a specific set of scripts and languages or "Any Script".
And a specific set of flags, or Any flags.
<P>
In the second half of the dialog you select the same information to specify
how the feature should be transformed. In the dialog at right any features
with the opentype tag 'isol' will be retagged with the apple feature/setting
&lt;2,2&gt; (Cursive connection). Anything left unspecified in the second
half will remain unchanged (so the script and flags are both unspecified
at right).
<P>
(This does not retag kerning information)<BR CLEAR=ALL>
