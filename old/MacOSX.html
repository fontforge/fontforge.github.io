  Building FontForge
</H2>
<P>
Before you do anything you must get a copy of the Mac Developer Tools. These
now ship with each new mac (on the CD labeled XCode), it is optional software,
you must explicitly install it, or you can get this
<A HREF="http://connect.apple.com/">from Apple</A> (you can either download
a 250Meg file, or pay them $20 to FedEx you a CD.
<P>
Then you must install X11. Again it ships with new macs, again it must be
explicitly installed. You need to install two X packages. The first is X11User
on the third install CD, the second is X11SDK on the XCode CD.
<P>
It is possible to build FontForge without X11. There will be no user interface,
but you can run scripts.
<P>
Thirdly you may choose to install some image libraries (I recommend at least
installing libpng). Currently FontForge only tries to link statically with
these libraries.
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html">libpng</A> (and required
    helper <A HREF="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">zlib</A>)
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://www.libtiff.org/">libtiff</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libungif.htm">libungif</A>
  <LI>
    (see the <A HREF="index.html#Dependencies">dependencies</A> entry for a more
    complete list)
</UL>
<P>
Finally you are ready to build fontforge. Download the most recent sources
<A HREF="index.html#source">from this site.</A> then:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>$ gunzip fontforge_full-*.tgz
$ tar xf fontforge_full-*.tar
$ cd fontforge
$ configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>
  Installing the Mac OS/X <A NAME="binary">binary</A> distribution
</H2>
<P>
Before installing FontForge you should ensure that you have X windows up
and running. Apple now ships this with new Macs, but it is optional software
(CD 3) and you must explicitly request it by customizing your install. You
can also get this <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/download/">from
apple</A>, or from <A HREF="http://www.osxgnu.org/">the GNU Mac OS/X site</A>.
(Or you can build fontforge without X, and end up with no user interface
but the ability to run scripts).
<P>
After that you should just be able to unpack the packages provided in the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103338">File
Release area.</A> You want the PPC (power PC) version.
<P>
These packages install into /usr/local/bin. You may need to add that to your
PATH environment variable, and do something similar for MANPATH:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>$ vi ~/.bashrc
PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH ; export PATH
MANPATH=/usr/local/share/man:$MANPATH ; export MANPATH
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
See the <A HREF="index.html#Dependencies">dependencies</A> section for external
libraries/programs you may want to add to your system to enhance FontForge's
capabilities.
<H2>
  <A NAME="Running">Running</A> FontForge on Mac OS/X
</H2>
<P>
The X server X11 (or XDarwin in older releases) must be running before FontForge
can start. X11 lives in the Utilities sub-folder of the Applications folder
and may be started by double clicking on it.
<P>
The first time you start X11, go to the applications menu and select "Customize
Menu..."<BR>
then press the (Add) button in the dialog which appears<BR>
double click in the left-most section of the blank line which just appeared
and then type "FontForge"<BR>
press the tab key and type "/usr/local/bin/fontforge"<BR>
press the tab key again and type "f"<BR>
then press (Done)
<P>
You may start FontForge by selecting FontForge from the X11 Applications
menu.
