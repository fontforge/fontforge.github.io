    <A NAME="metrics">Examining</A> and controlling metrics
  </H2>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="sidebearings.png" WIDTH="111" HEIGHT="191" ALIGN="Right">After
  you have created the shapes of your glyphs you must next figure out the spacing
  between glyphs. The space between any two glyph has two components, the space
  after the first glyph, and the space before the second glyph. In a left to
  right world these two are called the right side bearing and the left side
  bearing respectively.
  <P>
  The left side bearing may be changed by the simple expedient of
  <CODE>Edit-&gt;Select All</CODE> (in the outline view) and then dragging
  the selected objects to the appropriate place. The right side bearing may
  be changed by selecting the advance width line and adjusting it
  appropriately.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  However it is generally better not to set the metrics of a single glyph in
  isolation, you should see the glyph in the context of other glyphs and set
  it from that perspective. Use the <CODE>Window-&gt;Open
  <A HREF="metricsview.html">Metrics Window </A></CODE>command.<BR>
  <IMG SRC="MetricsView.png" WIDTH="479" HEIGHT="331"><BR>
  Any glyphs selected in the fontview (when you invoke the metrics view) will
  be displayed in the metrics view. You may change which glyphs are displayed
  by either typing new ones in to the text field at the top of the view, or
  by dragging a glyph from the fontview.
  <P>
  From here you may adjust any glyph's metrics by typing into the textfields
  below it, or you may select a glyph (by clicking on its image) and drag it
  around (to adjust the left side bearing), or drag its width line (to adjust
  its right side bearing).
  <P>
  If you want to generate a "typewriter" style font (where all glyphs have
  the same width) execute an <CODE>Edit-&gt;Select All</CODE> from the fontview
  and then <CODE>Metrics-&gt;Set Width</CODE>. This will set the widths of
  all glyphs to the same value. After doing that you might also want to execute
  <CODE>Metrics-&gt;Center in Width</CODE> to even out the left and right spacing
  on each glyph.
  <P>
  <I><IMG SRC="autowidth.png" WIDTH="276" HEIGHT="268" ALIGN="Right"></I>If
  all this manual operation seems too complicated, try
  <CODE><A HREF="autowidth.html#AutoWidth">Metrics-&gt;Auto Width</A></CODE>.
  This will automagically assign widths to glyphs. These widths are not up
  to professional standards, but they are generally reasonable approximations.
  <H3>
    <A NAME="Vertical">Vertical</A> Metrics
  </H3>
  <P>
  FontForge provides some support for the vertical metrics needed for CJK fonts.
  First you must tell FontForge that this font should contain vertical metrics,
  do this with <CODE>Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;General-&gt;Has Vertical
  Metrics</CODE>. Then in each outline glyph enable VMetrics in the Layers
  palette.
  <P>
  You should now see a vertical advance line somewhere underneath your glyph.
  You may drag this line just as you would the horizontal advance (width) line.
  <H3>
    Setting the <A NAME="baseline">baseline</A> to baseline spacing of a font.
  </H3>
  <P>
  You might imagine that there would be an easy way to set this seemingly important
  quantity. Unfortunately there is not.
  <DL>
    <DT>
      In a PostScript Type1 font (or bare CFF font)
    <DD>
      There is no way to set this value.<BR>
      At all, ever.<BR>
      In traditional typography the inter-line spacing is 1em (which in FontForge
      is the ascent+descent of a font). Some applications will use this. Other
      applications will use the font's bounding box (summing the maximum ascender
      height with the minimum descender depth) -- a very bad, but very common approach.
    <DT>
      In a TrueType or OpenType font
    <DD>
      Unfortunately this depends on the platform
      <DL>
	<DT>
	  Mac
	<DD>
	  On a mac the baseline to baseline spacing is determined again by the bounding
	  box values of the font, specified in the 'hhea' table, possibly modified
	  by a linegap (Which you can set in FontForge with
	  <A HREF="fontinfo.html">Element-&gt;FontInfo-&gt;OS/2</A>.
	<DT>
	  On Windows
	<DD>
	  According to the OpenType spec, the baseline to baseline distance is set
	  by the values of Typographic Ascent and Descent of the 'OS/2' table. These
	  can be set with
	  <A HREF="fontinfo.html">Element-&gt;FontInfo-&gt;OS/2</A>, but are usually
	  allowed to default to the Ascent and Descent values of FontForge -- they
	  generally sum to 1em and are equivalent to the traditional unleaded
	  default.<BR>
	  Again this may be modified by a linegap field.<BR>
	  Unfortunately Windows programs rarely follow the standard (which I expect
	  doesn't supprise anyone), and generally they will use the font's bounding
	  box as specified in the Win Ascent/Descent fields of the 'OS/2' table.
	<DT>
	  On linux/unix
	<DD>
	  I doubt there is any standard behavior. Unix apps will probably choose one
	  of the above.
      </DL>
  </DL>
  <P>
  Typographically ept applications will allow users to adjust baseline to baseline
  spacing, so the default value may not be all that relevant.
  <H2>
    <A NAME="Kerning">Kerning</A>
  </H2>
  <P>
  If you are careful in setting the left and right side-bearings you can design
  your font so that the spacing looks nice in almost all cases. But there are
  always some cases which confound simple solutions.
  <P>
  Consider "<FONT FACE="helvetica">To</FONT>" or
  "<FONT FACE="helvetica">Av</FONT>" here the standard choices are inappropriate.
  The "<FONT FACE="helvetica">o</FONT>" will look better if it can slide more
  to the left and snuggle under the top bar of the
  "<FONT FACE="helvetica">T</FONT>". This is called kerning, and it is used
  to control inter-glyph spacing on a pair-by-pair basis.
  <TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
    <CAPTION>
      Kerning
    </CAPTION>
    <TR>
      <TD><IMG SRC="To-unkerned.png" WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="323"></TD>
      <TD><IMG SRC="To-kerned.png" WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="323"></TD>
    </TR>
  </TABLE>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="addlookup-kern.png" WIDTH="439" HEIGHT="408" ALIGN="Right">In the
  above example the left image shows the unkerned text, the right shows the
  kerned text. To create a kerned pair in the metrics window, simply click
  on the right glyph of the pair, the line (normally the horizontal advance)
  between the two should go green (and becomes the kerned advance). Drag this
  line around until the spacing looks nice.
  <P>
  Sadly that statement is a simplification... Before you can create a kerning
  pair you must create a kerning lookup (see
  <A HREF="editexample4.html#lookups">the section on lookups</A>). Once again
  you bring up the Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Lookups pane and this time you
  must select the GPOS (Glyph Positioning) tab at the top of the pane. Once
  again you press <CODE>[Add Lookup]</CODE>. This time the lookup type is "Pairwise
  Positioning", and the feature is "kern" (or perhaps "vkrn" if you want to
  do vertical kerning).
  <P>
  Once you have created your lookup you again select it and press the [Add
  Subtable] button (which asks you to name the subtable). Then FontForge will
  ask you whether you want a subtable of kerning pairs or kerning classes.
  <P>
  If you have many glyphs which have similar kerning features you might wish
  to create a set of <A HREF="metricsview.html#kernclass">kerning classes</A>
  (which might say that A, &Agrave;, &Aacute;, &Acirc;, &Acirc;, &Atilde; and
  &Auml; all kern alike). However for this example you want a kerning pair
  subtable.<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="subtable-to.png" WIDTH="415" HEIGHT="441" ALIGN="Left">Then FontForge
  will popup a dialog allowing you to set the kerning subtable directly. You
  may set your kerning pairs from here, though I prefer the metrics view myself
  because you can see more glyphs and so get a better feel for the "color"
  of the font.
  <P>
  (Some glyph combinations are better treated by
  <A HREF="editexample4.html#ligature">creating a ligature </A>than by kerning
  the letters)
  <H3>
    <A NAME="VKern">Vertical</A> Kerning
  </H3>
  <P>
  FontForge has equivalent support for vertical kerning. It can read and write
  vertical kerning information from and to truetype, opentype and svg fonts.
  It allows you to create vertical kerning classes. The metrics window has
  a vertical mode in which you can set vertical kerning pairs. Finally it has
  a command which will copy horizontal kerning information to the vertically
  rotated glyphs (That is, if the combination "A" "V" is horizontally kerned
  by -200, then "A.vert" "V.vert" should be vertically kerned by -200.
  <P>
  (Vertical kerning is only available if the font has vertical metrics)
