Subject: [OpenType] Why you don't need UniqueIDs
Date: 	Fri, 04 Mar 2005 10:04:41 -0800
</PRE>
  <P>
  Neither Type 1 nor OpenType CFF fonts require PostScript UniqueIDs.
  <P>
  Back in the mid-80s, when printing might be done on a 57K serial connection
  and printers might have 8 MHz processors, the caching of device-generated
  bitmaps enabled by UniqueIDs made a noticeable speed difference. With today's
  connection bandwidths and printers, the printing speed difference was
  insignificant in our tests (conducted around 2002), and certainly not enough
  to outweigh the risks of collisions between UniqueIDs for different fonts
  and the trouble of tracking the ID numbers.
  <P>
  For these reasons, Adobe stopped using UniqueIDs (and XUIDs) in our own OpenType
  CFF fonts. If we still made Type 1 fonts, we wouldn't use UniqueIDs for them,
  either.
  <P>
  You may of course continue to use UniqueIDs, it's just that they are not
  necessary.
  <P>
