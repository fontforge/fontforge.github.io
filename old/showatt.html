  Show Advanced Typographic Features
</H1>
<P>
<IMG SRC="showatt.png" WIDTH="356" HEIGHT="661" ALIGN="Right">This dialog
shows the contents of some advanced typography tables (GDEF, GPOS and GSUB
for opentype fonts, kern, lcar, morx, opbd and prop for Apple fonts) as far
as fontforge understands them. The dialog is hierarchical with the typical
boxed +/- signs used for opening and closing sub-levels.
<P>
The GSUB and GPOS tables are organized as one might expect. Underneath each
table is a list of scripts, underneath each script is a list of languages,
underneath each language is a list of features, underneath each feature is
a list of glyphs, generally with some description of what happens (in the
example a right the 'frac' feature turns 1/4 into &#188;). Some features
are a little more complex (the 'kern' feature has a list of all glyphs that
kern with the first glyph under the first glyph).
<P>
The morx and kern tables are also broken up into scripts (Apple doesn't treat
scripts at all, but it makes the state machines smaller, so fontforge uses
the concept anyway), but languages are omitted (Apple tables will be based
on data for the default language).
<P>
Pressing the right mouse button will bring up a popup menu which will allow
you to save the contents of the dlg (as utf8 text).
