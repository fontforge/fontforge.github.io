      I am often asked this question; to me it represents a misapprehension. You
      wouldn't go up to a paintbrush maker and ask if he thought there were already
      enough watercolor paintings. A font is a work of art and represents the
      individual genius of its creator. It is no more redundant than a watercolor.

      FontForge has uses beyond simply creating and modifying fonts. It can convert
      from one format to another. It can extract information from the font file.
      Or it can simply show you what the font looks like without having to install
      it.

      <A NAME="widget-set"><B>Why is FontForge based on a non-standard widget
      set?</B></A>
    <DD>
      I wanted a widget set that would handle Unicode reasonably well. In particular
      I thought support for bidi text was important for hebrew and arabic typography.
      As I was unaware of any widget sets that did that, I wrote my own.<BR>
      I also wanted a widget set where I could actually figure out whether the
      checkbox was checked or not checked. In far too many cases my eyes can't
      work out which is which... (Ironically the most frequent complaint I get
      is from people who can't tell whether my checkboxes are checked. I don't
      know what to make of that).<BR>
      I realize now that that there are essentially two free widget sets that are
      far better at unicode support than mine. These are
      <A HREF="http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt">QT</A> and
      <A HREF="http://www.gtk.org/">gtk</A>. I'm still not using either because:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Converting from one set of widgets to another is tedious. And people send
	  me bugs which distract me.
	<LI>
	  If I spend my time doing that conversion I won't be making FontForge more
	  functional.
	<LI>
	  QT is written in C++, and, <A HREF="faq.html#C-plus-plus">as I explain
	  below</A>, I don't like C++, so that's out.
	<LI>
	  The more I look at gtk the less I like it.
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      The support for images is atrocious (which is odd, since it was written for
	      gimp):
	      <UL>
		<LI>
		  There is no support whatsoever for client side bitmaps (and I want to support
		  bitmap fonts)
		<LI>
		  Colors are ordered RGB in color tables for index images, but BGR for 24bit
		  color images
		<LI>
		  No simple support for transparent images without resorting to full RGBA images,
		  which is a bit of overkill when I want to draw a simple bitmap.
		<LI>
		  There is no overarching format for images, so I can't have an image which
		  itself knows whether it's bitmap, index or truecolor.
		<LI>
		  Fixing these was possible, but it involved a lot of very low level work on
		  my part -- and I only know how to do that work on X.
	      </UL>
	    <LI>
	      I find the file chooser dialog really ugly. And it's so complex I can't figure
	      out how to modify it to make it look nice (by my standards, that is).
	    <LI>
	      I also can't figure out how to modify the file chooser to make it behave
	      the way the fontforge's file chooser currently behaves (popup windows showing
	      FontNames as you move the mouse over fontfiles, a pull down list of recently
	      used files attached to the filename input box, etc.)

	      gtk+2 doesn't run natively on Mac OS, and the only people porting gtk to

      <A NAME="C-plus-plus"><B>Why isn't FontForge written in C++ (or <I>Why C++
      is not my favorite language</I>)?</B></A>
    <DD>
      I've been a little surprised to be asked this question, I had not realized
      my choice of language needed justification, but it appears to do so...
      <P>
      Basically because I don't find object-oriented practices helpful in most
      cases, because I find C++ far too complex and badly designed, and because
      I can't debug it easily.
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  I grew up with SIMULA and dabbled with SmallTalk and found after a few years
	  that there were very few problems where an object oriented approach seemed
	  natural to me. In most cases it just seemed to impose unneeded complexities
	  on the problem.
	<LI>
	  The semantics of a C++ program cannot be specified. The compiler is free
	  to generate temporaries as it wishes. In C this is not a problem, but in
	  C++ the creation of a temporary can involve calling a constructor and a
	  destructor which may have untold side-effects. I find this frightening.
	<LI>
	  The order of execution of external constructors is unspecified. I have seen
	  many inexplicable bugs caused by this
	<LI>
	  I find it extremely difficult to debug C++. Stepping through a statement
	  often involves many unexpected procedure calls (some of which are inlined
	  and not obvious). This distracts from my main purpose in debugging.
	<LI>
	  Finally I find the language badly specified and too complex. Its various
	  concepts do not fit well together. Each compiler seems to do things slightly
	  differently.
	  <P>
	  I first met C++ in about 1981 when it was called C with Classes. I wrote
	  the C++ front end for Green Hills Software's compiler suite from 1987 to
	  1994 and I tracked each new version of the language from 1.1 to ANSI.
	  <P>
	  Each version added new features which did not sit well with the old ones.
	  Each version was badly specified. The reference implementation was wildly
	  different from the specification. For example the behavior of virtual functions
	  inside constructors was not specified until version 2 of the language and
	  since this behavior was different from naive expectations this caused bugs.
	  My favorite confusion occurred in (I think it was) the version 2.1 specification
	  where on one page, within a few paragraphs, the following two sentences occurred:
	  "Unions may contain member functions." and "Unions may not contain member
	  functions.".
      </UL>
      <P>
      The above are my personal opinions based on my experience and explain why
      <I>I</I> do not use C++. Your opinions probably differ, few people have spent

      Perhaps I am naif, but I don't believe that anyone is going to start selling
      fontforge. Why would they? It makes no sense for someone to try to sell what
      I give away freely. If they add functionality to fontforge, then that's a
      different matter, but in a sense they aren't charging for fontforge, they
      are charging for the code they have added to it. It would be annoying if
      someone did that, a bit rude in my eyes, but I'm not going to say "no".
      <P>
      Now someone might take a small piece of fontforge and use it in something
      else. That doesn't bother me. I know that some of my OpenType code has been
      snagged by some TeX packages. And I have snagged code for generating checksums

      I want to download a package and just have it work.

      <P>
      When I can't figure out how to do something myself I will use an external
      library if I must. Even then I will try to insure that fontforge will run
      if the library is not present on a system. When I release a binary package
      I don't want to have to release 32 packages per host depending on the possible
      presence or absence of 5 different libraries. But I also don't want to force
      someone to install a library that s/he will never use just to get fontforge
      to start.
      <P>
      If a user will never look at an svg glyph then they don't need to install
      libxml2. If the user will never import a jpeg image (and there's really no
      reason to want to do that) then they don't need to install libjpeg.
      <P>
      Instead, the binaries I release will try to load a library dynamically (dlopen)
      <EM>when they need it</EM> and not before. This will also speed up starting
      fontforge. If the library is on the system then all is happy and nice. If
      the library is not, then that functionality is lost -- but the rest of fontforge
      continues to work.

      Consider python scripting. I decided to add python to fontforge. I found
      that meant it became easier to design a mechanism so users could create their
      own scripts to add import/export file formats. And then startup scripts,
      and scripts when certain standard "events" happened. And then I could allow
      users to define their own menu items. And then I figured out how to add fontforge
      to python (as opposed to the reverse). And now I realize that there is no
      reason I couldn't define a set of c-bindings so that people could call fontforge
      as a library from within C programs. And who knows where that will lead --
      if anywhere.

      Each stage means I can see a little further, and go a little further, and

      <A NAME="legal"><B>Is it legal to modify a font? Is it ethical?</B></A>
    <DD>
      Many current fonts are based on the work of great designers from centuries
      past -- so reusing other people's designs has a long history. On the other
      hand, no matter what the law, it is clearly unethical to steal the work of
      a living designer.
      <P>
      Legal matters vary from country to country (and perhaps within countries).
      You really should consult a lawyer for a definitive answer. Here are some
      guidelines:
      <P>
      Look at the license agreement you received with the font and see what it
      has to say on this issue.
      <P>
      TrueType (and OpenType and potentially CID-keyed fonts) have a field in the
      OS/2 table called FSType which allows the font designer to place restrictions
      on what other people can do with the font. If this field prohibits modification
      fontforge will ask you to make sure you have an agreement with the font designer
      which supersedes this field.
      <P>
      My understanding of US law (but check with a lawyer before relying on this)
      is that:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  There is minimal legal protection for font designs. Ages ago some legal figure
	  claimed "The alphabet is public." This meant a type design could not be
	  copyrighted.
	  <P>
	  However (I'm told) a designer may register (with the government) for a design
	  patent which protects the design for 14 years (if granted). I don't believe
	  it can be renewed, but I may be wrong.
	  <P>
	  Registering for a patent is an expensive and time-consuming process and is
	  often outside the ability of a small design firm. As far as I know the law
	  has never been tested in the US so the protection may be questionable.
	<LI>
	  Font <EM>programs</EM> (such as a postscript or truetype font file, but not
	  a bitmap font file) may be copyrighted. This means the design itself is not
	  protected, but the mechanism for creating it is.
	<LI>
	  Font names may be trademarked.
      </UL>
      <P>
      My understanding is that in the UK:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  There is something called a "design right" which is somewhat like a copyright
	  and protects a design for 5 years. A designer may also register the design
	  with the government up to 5 times to extend this protection to 25 years.
      </UL>
      <P>
      Throughout the EU:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  There are EU design rights. I'm not sure about the specifics of these, nor
	  how they interact with country specific laws (as the British design rights
	  above).
      </UL>
      <P>
      In Canada:
      <UL>

	  Font designs may be registered as "industrial designs" for a limited time

      The pointsize is not based on the sizes of any of the glyphs of the font.
      <P>
      Back when fonts were made out of metal, the pointsize of the font was the
      height of the metal slugs used for that font.
      <P>
      In some sense this is not a very good measure of the size of a font (some
      fonts may allow more room for accents or ascenders or descenders than others
      meaning that the height of the actual glyphs will be smaller).
      <P>
      There is also a measurement scheme based on the x-height of the glyphs.
      <P>
      In England and the US a point has traditionally meant the pica point
      (1/72.27<SUP>th </SUP>of an inch), while in Europe the point has been the
      didot point (1/67.54<SUP>th</SUP> of an inch). The Europeans have a slightly
      larger point, but the glyphs of English and European fonts appear the same
      size. English does not use accents (except in very rare cases) while most
      European languages do, and the slight increase in the size of the point allows
      more room for accents.
      <P>
      (Of course now most Europeans are probably forced to use the pica point by
      their desktop software, while most computer fonts now contain accented glyphs,
      so the distinction and the reason for it may have vanished).

      <A NAME="linespace"><B>How do I set the line spacing on a font?</B></A>
    <DD>
      It depends on the kind of font you are generating, the operating system under
      which you are running, and luck.
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  For Type1 fonts there is no way to set the line spacing. Applications will
	  often take the values specified in the font's bounding box and use those
	  to set the line spacing. This is a really bad idea on their part, but it
	  is common practice.
	<LI>
	  For True/Open Type fonts the answer is complicated.
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      On the mac<BR>
	      The line spacing is set by the ascender and descender values of the 'hhea'
	      table. These in turn are set to the bounding box values of the font. Not
	      a good choice. You can control these values from
	      <A HREF="fontinfo.html#TTF-Metrics" TARGET="_top">Element-&gt;Font
	      Info-&gt;OS/2-&gt;Metrics</A>.
	    <LI>
	      On windows<BR>
	      Line spacing is supposed to be set to the Typo Ascent/Typo Desent values
	      specified in the OS/2 table. And these in turn are supposed to sum to the
	      emsize. (FontForge sets these values to the ascent/descent values you specify
	      for your font). Unfortunately most windows applications don't follow this
	      rule, and instead base linespacing on the Win Ascent/Descent values of the
	      OS/2 table. These values are supposed to specify a clipping region for the
	      font (not line spacing). The clipping region should be as big as the font's
	      bounding box, but in some cases needs to be bigger. Again these may be set
	      from <A HREF="fontinfo.html#TTF-Metrics" TARGET="_top">Element-&gt;Font
	      Info-&gt;OS/2-&gt;Metrics</A>.
	      <P>
	      (The clipping region should be bigger than the bounding box if a GPOS lookup
	      could move a glyph so that it extended beyond the bounding box (mark to base
	      is likely to cause problems). I'm not sure how this applies to cursive
	      positioning in Urdu where GPOS lookups can make lines arbetrarily tall)
	      <P>
	      MicroSoft has added a redundant bit to the OS/2 table, which essentially
	      tells applications they should follow the standard and use the Typographic
	      linespacing fields. This bit is called UseTypoMetrics in OpenType, and in
	      FontForge it is available as Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;OS/2
	      -&gt;Metrics-&gt;Really Use Typo Metrics.
	    <LI>
	      On linux<BR>
	      I don't know that there is a general consensus. An application will probably
	      use one of the above methods.
	  </UL>
      </UL>
      <P>
      Actually this is not a very useful question any more. Modern fonts tend to
      have several different scripts in them and the different scripts may have
      different line spacing requirements. Even within one script there may be
      differences (English uses no (or extremely few) accented letters, while most
      other European languages use accents, thus English could be set more densely
      than German).
      <P>
      Instead of having one global measurement which controls the line spacing
      for all uses of the font, it is better to have more specific measures which
      control the line spacing dependent on conditions. The OpenType
      <A HREF="baseline.html" TARGET="_top">'BASE' table </A>does this. It allows
      you to specify extent data depending on script, language and active feature
      (for example, a 'mkmk' feature might increase the line spacing). I don't
      know whether any applications actually make use of these data
    <DT>
      <A NAME="em-units"><B>How big will my glyphs be?</B></A>
    <DD>
      Unfortunately this seemingly simple question cannot be answered. Your glyphs
      may be any size. Outline glyphs may be scaled and even bitmap glyphs will
      be different sizes depending on the screen resolution.
      <P>
      Suppose instead that you have an outline font that you draw at 12 points.
      Then we can answer the question.
      <P>
      Suppose you have a dash glyph that is 500 internal units long, and the font
      has an em-size of 1000 units. Then your glyph will be 500/1000 * 12 = 6points
      long. On a 72 dpi screen this will mean the dash is 6 pixels long.
      <P>
      <B>What are em-units? (internal units?)</B>
      <P>
      When you create your font you can use
      <A HREF="fontinfo.html#PS-General" TARGET="_top">Element-&gt;Font
      Info-&gt;General</A> to provide an em-size for your font. This is the sum
      of the typographic ascent and descent (in the days of metal fonts, the height
      of the metal slugs, the baseline to baseline distance). Generally the em-size
      will be 1000 or 2048. This gives you the number of internal units (also called
      em-units) used to represent em.
      <P>
      Within fontforge outline glyphs are displayed using the coordinate system

	      I'd suggest that you look at the
	      <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Font-HOWTO.html">linux
	      font HOWTO file</A>, and the
	      <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/FDU/">font
	      deuglification HOWTO</A> as good starting points. But I'll run over the
	      highlights
	      <P>
	      Essentially you designate one (or several) directories as a "font directory".
	      You move your fonts to that directory. You build up certain data structures
	      that X needs, and you tell X to include this directory in your font path.
	      Sadly different versions of X and the X font server use slightly different
	      conventions. You may need to alter these procedures a bit.
	      <P>
	      For example, if you want to install a <EM>bdf font </EM>called frabnuts-13.bdf
	      then you might:
	      <BLOCKQUOTE>
		<PRE>$ mkdir my_fonts
$ mv frabnuts-13.bdf my_fonts
$ cd my_fonts
$ bdftopcf frabnuts-13.bdf &gt;frabnuts-13.pcf
$ mkfontdir
$ xset fp+ `pwd`
</PRE>
	      </BLOCKQUOTE>
	      <P>
	      and your fonts should be installed. After that, whenever you start X you
	      need to remind it of where your fonts live, so you should add<BR>
	      <CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ xset fp+ /home/me/my_fonts</CODE><BR>
	      to your .xsession (or equivalent).
	      <P>
	      If you want to install <EM>postscript fonts</EM><BR>
	      You should generate them as postscript binary (.pfb) files, then move both
	      the .pfb and the .afm file into (one of) your font directory(ies) and run
	      <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=type1inst">type1inst</A>
	      in it.<BR>
	      type1inst will probably complain that your font doesn't have a foundry and
	      will probably get the encoding wrong. You can either:
	      <UL>
		<LI>
		  Ignore it and nothing bad will happen
		<LI>
		  Manually edit fonts.scale after running type1inst to fix these entries
		<LI>
		  Make your font's Copyright be reasonable, and then edit type1inst and add
		  your foundry (directions for this are in type1inst itself)
	      </UL>
	      <P>
	      If you want to install <EM>truetype fonts</EM><BR>
	      You move the .ttf file into your font directory and run mkttfdir and
	      mkfontdir.<BR>
	      (<A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=mkttfdir">mkttfdir</A>
	      has a small problem with fonts created by FontForge, it will almost invariably
	      complain that it doesn't recognize the foundry. You can safely ignore this,
	      but if it bothers you then add a line to ttmkfdir.c at 936<BR>

	      <P>
	      Some versions of X (ie, those shipped by redhat) rely on the x font server
	      to do font work rather than the X server itself. You may need to use chkfontpath
	      to add your new directory to the font server's font path (rather than xset
	      fp).<BR>
	      You may also need to insure that the font directory (and all its parent
	      directories) are readable to world. (the font server runs as a non-privileged
	      user)
	      <P>
	      I haven't seen anything that says X supports <EM>opentype</EM> fonts yet,
	      but since freetype does (and I think X's rasterizer uses freetype) then X
	      might support them too. Installing them will require manual editing of
	      fonts.scale though (mkttfdir uses freetype1 which doesn't support otf files).
	      <P>
	      That sounds really confusing. I apologize, I'm not a good writer and there

	  Traditionally the macintosh has stored fonts in the resource fork of files
	  (after about OS/8.5 I believe the mac also supported bare .ttf files). This
	  causes problems for any machine other than a mac, because the very concept
	  of a resource fork is lacking.<BR>
	  There are several programs whose job it is to store all of a macintosh file
	  in one package that can be manipulated on other systems (mac binary and binhex
	  are the most common). FontForge knows how to read both of these formats and
	  can extract a postscript or truetype font from either. FontForge can also
	  create fonts in macbinary format (I see no reason to support both output
	  formats, and macbinary is slightly simpler).<BR>
	  So to edit a font on your mac:

		  Fetch will automatically undo the macbinary wrappers and make it be correct
		<LI>
		  Or various other tools can unwrap it.
	      </UL>
	    <LI>
	      Drop it back into your system folder (where it is automagically moved to

	  <A TARGET="_top" HREF="filemenu.html#GenerateMac">File-&gt;Generate Mac

	  <P>
	  All the fonts in a family must have the same Family name (See the

	  are handled rather differently under Carbon (the old font handling mechanism
	  used in OS 9) and under ATSUI (on OS/X).
	  <P>
	  Under Carbon, the font family is limited by the design of the Mac 'FOND'
	  resource, which reflects the computer font technology of the early 1980s.
	  Modern computer fonts often have variants that can't be expressed in it.
	  FONDs support any combination (except one containing both Extend and Condense)
	  of the following styles:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Bold
	    <LI>
	      Italic

	      Shadow
	    <LI>
	      Outline

	  <P>
	  Mac FONDS do not support "Black", "DemiBold", "Light", "Thin" or
	  "Extra-Condensed" variants.
	  <P>
	  Under ATSUI, on the other hand, a family seems to consist of all fonts in
	  a given resources file which have the same FamilyName.
	  <P>
	  In order that a family be useful under both systems, Apple appears to place
	  several FONDs inside such a font file. Each FOND contains a sub-family of
	  related fonts. The 'FOND's appear to be distributed as follows:
	  <P>
	  Suppose you have a family of fonts with the following styles:<BR>
	  Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold-Italic, Condense, Condense-Italic, Oblique, Light,
	  Light-Italic, Black<BR>
	  Then you should create a font family with the styles that the FOND does support,
	  which in this case would be<BR>
	  Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold-Italic, Condense, Condense-Italic<BR>
	  For each of these use
	  <A HREF="fontinfo.html#FONDName" TARGET="_top">Element-&gt;Font
	  Info-&gt;Mac</A> to set the FondName field to the font's family name.
	  <P>
	  Change the fondname of the other styles, so that the Oblique style has Oblique
	  in the fond name, the two Light styles have Light in the fond name, and so
	  on. Set the <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Mac-Style" TARGET="_top">Mac Style</A>
	  on the "Light" variant of the font to be Regular (everything unselected)
	  and set the style of the "Light-Italic" variant to be "Italic" -- that is,
	  forget about the "Light", the FOND can't handle it, that's why we moved it
	  into its own FOND.
	  <P>
	  Having done this setup, the <A HREF="filemenu.html#GenerateMac">Generate
	  Mac Family </A>command should be able to put all the fonts into appropriate
	  FONDs, and then place all the FONDs into one file, which the Mac should interpret

      This is really a limitation on ATM's part and there's nothing FontForge can

      If you generate a font with an encoding other than Macintosh Latin, then

      There are a number of similarities between the results achieved by these
      formats, but the overlap is not total. Most conversions will lose some
      information.<BR>
      The simple answer is that this is pretty much automatic. You load an apple
      font, and then Generate an equivalent font with the [*] OpenType checkbox
      checked in the Options dialog.<BR>
      FontForge will convert any non-contextual features where Apple's feature/setting
      matches an OpenType feature. (This includes non-contextual ligatures even
      though they live in a contextual format). For more information see the section

      Both PostScript and TrueType require that glyphs be drawn in a clockwise
      fashion. Some rasterizers don't care. But other rasterizers will have
      difficulties with counter-clockwise paths and produced stems of different
      widths when they should be the same, or fuzzy stems, or even nothing at all.
      The solution to this is to run Element-&gt;Correct Direction on all your

      The X server does not have a good idea about screen resolution, and when
      fontforge asks it, the answer is often wrong. The result is that ff may use
      fonts that are too small (potentially too big too, but no one has complained
      about that one yet). You can tell fontforge the true screen size by adding
      a line like
      <BLOCKQUOTE>

      You don't. Just insure that all the glyphs in the font have the same width
      and then FontForge will automatically mark it as monospaced for you. (If
      you mark it as monospaced incorrectly some rasterizers will give strange
      results).<BR>
      If you want to set a font's panose values yourself
      (<A HREF="fontinfo.html#Panose" TARGET="_top">Element-&gt;Font
      Info-&gt;OS/2-&gt;Panose</A>) then set the Proportion field to Monospaced.
      This is necessary but not sufficient to mark the font as a whole as monospaced.
      <P>
      If you are unsure whether all the glyphs in your font have the same advance

      <P>
      When I say "all glyphs" I really mean <EM>all</EM> glyphs. Even glyphs which
      unicode says should be 0 width must have the same width as everything else.
      MicroSoft suggests that GPOS be used to do accent combination (etc.) and

      <A NAME="new-encoding"><B>How I do tell fontforge about a new
      encoding</B></A>
    <DD>
      First ask yourself if you really need a new encoding? If you are using OpenType
      or TrueType fonts you can usually get by with the standard unicode encoding.
      But if you really need a new one here is a rough idea of what to do:
      <P>
      Figure out what your encoding looks like. Often this will involve searching
      around the web to find an example of that encoding. For instance if you want
      a devanagari encoding you might look at
      <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/indic.html">a
      site which shows the ISCII encodings</A>
      <P>
      These encodings only show the top 96 characters, presumably the others are
      the same as US ASCII. Look at the images and figure out how they map to unicode
      (or more precisely what the appropriate postscript names are for those
      characters).
      <P>
      Create a file (call it "Devanagari.ps" in this case). It should start with
      a line:
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<PRE>/Devanagari {
</PRE>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>
      This tells FontForge that the encoding is called "Devanagari", then follow
      this with a list of all the character names (preceded by a slash). We start
      with ASCII which starts with 32 .notdef characters, then space, etc.
      <BLOCKQUOTE>

      here (generally for compatibility with old encodings). I am aware of the
      following issues:
      <DL>
	<DT>
	  Delta
	<DD>
	  is assigned to U+2206, "INCREMENT" rather than U+0394, "GREEK CAPITAL LETTER
	  DELTA", probably because Increment was part of the old MacRoman encoding.
	<DT>
	  Omega
	<DD>
	  is assigned to U+2126, "OHM SIGN", rather than U+03A9, "GREEK CAPITAL LETTER

	<DT>
	  mu
	<DD>
	  is assigned to U+00B5, "MICRO SIGN", rather than U+03BC, "GREEK SMALL LETTER
	  MU", probably because Micro Sign was part of ISO-Latin1 and MacRoman
	<DT>
	  omega1
	<DD>
	  Unicode calls this glyph "GREEK PI SYMBOL". It looks like an omega though.
	<DT>
	  Tcommaaccent, tcommaaccent
	<DD>
	  are assigned to U+0162,U+0163 "LATIN CAPITAL/SMALL LETTER T WITH CEDILLA",
	  rather than U+021A,U+021B "LATIN CAPITAL/SMALL LETTER T WITH COMMA BELOW",
	  probably because of a confusion in the early Unicode spec.
	<DT>
	  dotlessj
	<DD>
	  is assigned to U+F6BE (in the private use area) rather than U+0237 "LATIN
	  SMALL LETTER DOTLESS J", because Adobe saw the need for a dotlessj glyph
	  before Unicode did and assigned a slot in the private use area. Then in 4.1
	  Unicode added the glyph to the standard.

    <DT>
      <B><A NAME="non-integral">Is it safe to use non-integral coordinates?</A></B>
    <DD>
      FontForge allows you to edit with non-integral coordinates. Many font editors
      don't and some have wondered if the use of non-integral coordinates will
      it distort their fonts when they are rasterized?
      <P>
      The answer depends on the font format and how you save the font.
      <P>
      TrueType fonts can only express integral coordinates. When FontForge creates
      a TrueType font it will round all coordinates to integers. This rounding
      will introduce a slight distortion in the curve.
      <P>
      PostScript (type1, PostScript OpenType, type2, etc.) fonts can express
      non-integral coordinates in the font format -- but it takes a lot more space
      in the font file. Type1 fonts tend to take more space to express this than
      type2 (opentype) fonts. By default FontForge will round to int on these as
      well, BUT you can change that in the Generate Options dialog.
      <P>
      If your font is rounded then there will be some distortion. If it is not
      rounded there should be no distortion. In PostScript fonts it should be safe
      to use non-integral coordinates provided you turn off rounding when you generate
      the font. The font file will be bigger, but more accurate.
      <P>
      If you feel you need more accuracy in TrueType you can change the em-size
      to 8096.
      <P>
      You can do this on PostScript Type1 fonts too, however, there are some
      applications which assume that all OpenType postscript fonts have an em-size
      of 1000, so it is best not to do this for OpenType output.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Open-size"><B>Why isn't my Open Type font much smaller than the
      .pfb file?</B></A>
    <DD>
      This is probably because you didn't round to int before saving the font.
      FontForge will save the font using fixed point numbers which take up a lot
      more space than normal integers.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Open-difference"><B>What's the difference between OpenType and
      PostScript (or TrueType) fonts?</B></A>
    <DD>
      Both PostScript and TrueType define a file format and a glyph format. OpenType
      uses the TrueType file format with a PostScript glyph format (actually OpenType
      includes the TrueType glyph format as well, but the OpenType definition says
      such fonts should still be called TrueType fonts so I ignore that aspect).
      <P>
      The PostScript used in OpenType is slightly different from that used in .pfa
      and .pfb files. pfa/b files are Type1 fonts while OpenType uses Type2 fonts.
      Type2 is almost a superset of Type1 with a few minor changes and many extensions.
      Adobe's subroutine based extensions to Type1 (flex hints, hint substitution,
      counter hints) have been added to Type2 as direct instructions.<BR>
      OpenType can also include additional information (see
      <A HREF="#AAT-Open">below</A>) that allows for the layout of complex scripts
      (Arabic, Indic, etc.) as when as support for glyph variants and other aspects
      of fine typography.

      information for laying out complex scripts (like Arabic or Indic scripts)
      as well as support for glyph variants and other aspects of fine typography.
      They use totally different internal formats for the more complex aspects
      of this task, formats which have different expressive powers so that neither
      format can be converted to the other without the possibility for some loss
      of information. I discuss this in greater detail

    <DD>
      With Tiger (Mac OS/X.4) Apple added some support for OpenType. Some OpenType
      features are converted (at runtime) into AAT features. This is good, but
      not all features have corresponding Apple feature/settings, and not all lookups
      can be converted (conditional lookups cannot be). Unfortunately if a font
      contains both OpenType and AAT features Apple now ignores the AAT features
      (or so I have been told). The result is that AAT features, which presumably
      work, will not be used, while OpenType features, which are not completely
      supported and so won't work, are used instead.

      There are two reasons why this might be happening.
      <OL>
	<LI>
	  Even though you haven't changed anything in this session, FontForge may need
	  to (re)generate hinting information on one or several glyphs (if, for example
	  those glyphs have been changed (in an earlier session) but no hints have
	  been generated for them since). These new hints will mark the font as changed.
	<LI>
	  If your font has an XUID field in the Font Info, then FontForge will increment
	  the final number in the XUID each time a postscript font is generated --
	  and this also counts as a change. (Why does FontForge do this? Because Adobe
	  says it should. A minor annoyance, but it avoids some problems with font
	  caching when you change an old version of the font for a new one).
      </OL>
    <DT>
      <B><A NAME="TeX">Why doesn't TeX work with my fonts?</A></B>
    <DD>
      I'm a total novice with TeX. I am told that TeX (or some part of the TeX
      chain, dvips perhaps) expects fonts to be encoded in TeX base Encoding --
      sometimes called "Adobe Standard" by the TeX docs, but it isn't it's TeX
      base. So if you are having printing problems, missing glyphs, etc. try changing
      the encoding of your font to TeX Base (Go to Element-&gt;Font Info, select
      the Encoding tab, select TeX Base from the pulldown list).
    <DT>
      <A NAME="mf-files"><B>Why doesn't FontForge let me edit an '.mf'

    <DD>
      As Knuth said "(the problem with WSYWYG is that...) What you see is
      <I>all</I> you get." FontForge suffers from this.
      <P>
      Let us take a simple example. Suppose we have a point defined by<BR>
      <CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;top<SUB>1</SUB>y<SUB>2</SUB> = CapHeight</CODE><BR>
      And the user tries to drag point 2 to a new y location. How should FontForge
      interpret this? It could:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Change <CODE>CapHeight</CODE>
	<LI>
	  Change the width of pen 1
	<LI>
	  Change the equation to something like:<BR>
	  <CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp;top<SUB>1</SUB>y<SUB>2</SUB> = CapHeight - 30</CODE>
	<LI>
	  Or to something like:<BR>

	<LI>
	  Or to half a dozen other things.

      So FontForge's method for moving a point around is ambiguous. And I haven't

      FontForge. So you can't use meta-middle-click to minify a glyph, you have
      to use the View menu-&gt;Zoom Out instead.

      <A NAME="no-mu"><B>Why isn't there a character named "mu" in my greek
      font?</B></A>
    <DD>
      Adobe was thinking more of backwards compatibility than sense when they assigned
      the names of the greek letters in their unicode encoding. Thus the name "mu"
      refers to the Micro Sign (U+00B5) and not to the letter mu. They also assigned
      Delta to Increment, and Omega to Ohm Sign.
      <P>
      <P>
      Adobe has also decided that the character at U+03D6 (said by the Unicode
      consortium to refer to "GREEK PI SYMBOL") should be named "omega1", when
      "pi1" seems more appropriate.

      <A NAME="no-copy-names"><B>Why doesn't Edit-&gt;Copy copy glyph names as
      well as glyph info?</B></A>
    <DD>
      Firstly because I believe that any attempt to copy a glyph's name will almost
      certainly be better done by defining a custom
      <A TARGET="_top" HREF="encodingmenu.html">encoding</A>.<BR>
      Secondly because most of the time you don't want the name copied.<BR>
      Thirdly because it is esthetically better that copy should only work with
      data and not meta-data.<BR>
      HOWEVER... enough people have asked this question that I've enabled a mode
      in <A TARGET="_top" HREF="editmenu.html#CharName">Edit-&gt;Copy From-&gt;Char

    <DT>
      <A NAME="cidmaps"><B>What on earth are cidmap files and should I care about
      them?</B></A>
    <DD>
      Some background:
      <P>
      When postscript was invented every glyph in a font was given a name, and
      an encoding which was specified by a 256 element array mapping character
      codes to names.
      <P>
      Then they started thinking about CJK fonts (and perhaps Unicode), which have
      huge glyph sets, and coming up with reasonable ASCII names for 10,000 glyphs
      was <SMALL>a)</SMALL> a waste of space, <SMALL>b)</SMALL> fairly meaningless.
      So then adobe created CID-keyed fonts which have no glyph names and no encodings.
      Every glyph has an index (a CID), which is just a number, and this is sort
      of treated as a name. Then external to the font is an additional resource
      (a cmap) which provides the encoding for the font (and can support really
      grungy encoding schemes like SJIS), by mapping a sequence of input bytes
      to a CID.
      <P>
      Adobe provides certain standard cmap resources (ie. one for SJIS, one for
      JIS, one for Extended Unix whatever). Because these files are fairly painful
      to write Adobe has assigned standard meanings to CIDs so that everyone can
      use the same cmap file. -- Well actually there are 5 or 6 different standards,
      Japanese (JIS208), Japanese (JIS212), Korean, Chinese (Hong Kong, Taiwan),
      Chinese (Mainland, Singapore), Identity (Unicode) -- So CID 1 might be space,
      CID 2 might be "!", CID 935 might be "Katakana ka", etc.
      <P>
      My cidmap files just give me a mapping between Adobe's CIDs and Unicode.
      This allows FontForge to know what glyph it is working on. If they aren't
      present things should work ok, but FontForge would fill the font view with
      "?" rather than the appropriate glyph. And FontForge wouldn't be able to
      reencode the font into Unicode or anything else.
      <P>
      <P>
      So the cidmap files are only useful for people working on CID keyed CJK fonts.
      So many europeans/americans won't need them.

      <B>Does the <A NAME="simplify">simplify</A> command lose accuracy?</B>
    <DD>
      Yes it does.<BR>
      But not much.<BR>
      It is designed to replace a set of splines with another spline that nowhere
      differs from the original by more than one unit in the local coordinate
      system.<BR>
      If this level of accuracy is not good enough then (In the outline view):
      <UL>

	  Edit-&gt;Select-&gt;Select All

      This will replace a set of splines with a spline that differs from the original

      <A NAME="cubic-quadratic"><B>How does FontForge convert a cubic spline into
      a quadratic spline for truetype?</B></A>
    <DD>
      Again this can involve a loss of accuracy.<BR>
      First FontForge checks to see if the spline happens to be a quadratic already
      (this would happen if you'd just read in a truetype font, or if a miracle
      occurred when you generated the spline).<BR>
      Otherwise FontForge will divide the original spline into smaller chunks and
      try to find a set of quadratic splines that differ from the cubic by no more
      than one unit anywhere. (Once you have picked two end-points and know the
      slope at those end-points there is only one quadratic spline possible between
      the two).
    <DT>
      <A NAME="quadratic-cubic"><B>How does FontForge convert a quadratic spline
      into a cubic (when reading truetype)?</B></A>
    <DD>
      This is easy since any quadratic spline can already be represented as a cubic,
      it will just happen that the cubic term is always 0.
      <P>
      Probably the control points will no longer be at integral coordinates and
      there will be some loss of precision when they are saved in a cubic format.
    <DT>
      <B><A NAME="dynamic-libs">Why does fontforge say "Error loading dynamic library"
      when trying to import an image file?</A></B>
    <DD>
      FontForge depends on certain dynamic libraries to load images. It does not
      check for the existance of these libraries until you actually try to load
      an image. If the library has not been installed on your system it will give
      the above error (and fail to load the image).<BR>
      The <A HREF="source-build.html#Dependencies" TARGET="_top">Dependencies</A>
      section of the main page describes how to find these libraries.<BR>
      If the libraries are installed and you still get this message try setting
      your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to the directory containing the library in
      question (On the mac this is DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH).
    <DT>
      <B><A NAME="complex-eps">Why does fontforge say "EPS file is too complex

    <DD>
      (Well because it is a misquotation of Shakespeare, and how could I pass that
      up? <I>Much Ado About Nothing, V . i. 217</I>)<BR>
      Most programs which load eps files treat them as black boxes. They will read
      the file into memory and output it, unchanged, to a postscript printer.
      Unfortunately FontForge cannot do this. FontForge needs to understand and
      then convert the eps file into a simpler format (fonts can use far fewer
      operations than an eps file). So unlike most programs FontForge must interpret
      each eps file -- but interpretting all of PostScript is a huge job and ff
      is limited in what it understands. Sometimes it will find a file it can't
      handle.

      <A NAME="default-char"><B>How do I set the default glyph of a font?</B></A>
    <DD>
      If the glyph named ".notdef" contains some splines (but no references) then
      it will be used as the default glyph (that is the glyph used when an unencoded
      glyph is called for).
      <P>
      Except that in a OpenType font (that is, a PostScript OpenType font), the
      .notdef glyph is not used for the default glyph, instead the "space" glyph
      is. (Don't look at me, I didn't write the spec.)
    <DT>
      <A NAME="ttf-degrade"><B>I loaded a ttf font, made a few changes and generated
      a new font. The changed glyphs don't look anywhere near as nice as the originals.
      Why?</B></A>
    <DD>
      When FontForge reads in a truetype font it saves all the hinting (instructions)
      that were present in the original. But if you change a glyph in any significant
      way those instructions are no longer valid (they depend intimately on the
      details of the outlines), so FontForge removes them when you make a change.
      The result is that changing a glyph with FontForge will degrade its appearance
      in most truetype fonts (not all, some have no hints).<BR>
      FontForge can generate truetype instructions for you itself, but you must
      ask it to do so -- use the Hints-&gt;AutoInstr command.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="otf-diffs"><B>I generated an opentype font and windows wouldn't
      install it. Why not?</B></A>
    <DD>
      Unfortunately Apple and MicroSoft (and Adobe) do not agree on the proper
      format for open and truetype fonts. FontForge has a check box on the Generate
      Font Options dialog labelled [] Apple. Make sure this is checked when you
      are generating a font for the mac. Make sure this is not checked when generating
      a font for Windows (and probably for unix too, though unix tends to be less
      picky).
      <P>
      The major differences I've stumbled onto so far are:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  The postscript name entry in the NAME table.<BR>
	  (I am told that this is actually an error in Apple's version of the spec,
	  and the behavior of the Mac matches that of Windows).
	<LI>
	  The names of the tables containing bitmap fonts
	<LI>
	  The way scaled references are stored
	<LI>
	  And the tables containing advanced typographical features are completely
	  different
      </UL>
    <DT>
      <A NAME="DSIG"><B>I have a truetype font with opentype tables, but windows
      displays the "TT" (truetype) icon and not the "O" icon. Why?</B></A>
    <DD>
      As far as I can tell Windows will mark a truetype font with the "O" icon
      if that font contains a 'DSIG' (Digital Signature) table. FontForge does
      not produce digital signatures (I think they are of negative utility, and
      anyway I don't know how to create them).<BR>
      However, it is possible to <A HREF="generate.html#Options" TARGET="_top">ask
      FontForge to create a 'DSIG' table </A>which contains no signatures. That
      seems enough to make windows happy.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="names"><B>What do all the different font names mean?</B></A>
    <DD>
      When <CODE>Element-&gt;Font Info</CODE>opens it shows a Names pane with several
      different fields. Why are there so many and what do they all mean?
      <P>
      The Names pane contains names used in PostScript fonts. There is also a
      <CODE>TTF Names</CODE> pane which contains a similar set of names used in
      sfnts (an sfnt is a font file format which includes truetype, opentype, and
      a number of more obscure font formats).
      <P>
      A font may be PostScript wrapped in an sfnt. In this case it can have both
      a set of PostScript names, and a set of sfnt (ttf) names. Those names could
      be different (that's usually not a good idea, but they <EM>could</EM> be).
      <P>
      The "name for humans" is the name traditionally associated with a font. It
      might be something like "ITC New Century Schoolbook Italic #4". It's a string
      which applications can use to display when they want humans to know what
      the font is.
      <P>
      The fontname exists because PostScript is a programming language and this
      is the name used to identify the font <EM>within PostScript</EM>. It has
      restrictions on the characters which may be in the name (no spaces is the
      biggest. but it also can't look like a number, no parentheses, etc.) and
      on the length of the name. It might look like "ITCNewCenturySchoolbook-Italic".
      <P>
      The family name is the name of a family of related fonts. In the above example
      "ITC New Century Schoolbook" would probably be the family name.
      <P>
      "Base Filename" isn't really a name associated with the font itself. It's
      just there to make your life easier when using fontforge. When you generate
      a font, ff will pick a default filename for you (you can always change it,
      of course, but it is handy if the default name is the one you want to use).
      <P>
      Normally the default name will be just the fontname with an extension added
      (ITCNewCenturySchoolbook-Italic.ttf). But sometimes people want a different
      name for the default, perhaps just NewCentSchlBk-Ital.ttf. This lets you
      do than.
      <P>
      So it controls the default FILENAME for the file containing the font, and
      does not directly relate to anything in the font itself.
      <P>
      The weight string is something like "Bold", "Black", "Thin", etc. It does
      not include other stylistic variations (you would not put Italic or Condensed
      here).
      <P>
      The copyright string should be self-explanatory. 
	<HR width="50%">
      In addition to the "Names" pane of Font Info, there is also a TTF Names pane.
      <P>
      In many ways this is a duplicate of the Names pane but with some differences.
      It is used to specify names for sfnts.
      <P>
      Here you have
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Family<BR/>
	  This corresponds to the PostScript Family
	<LI>
	  SubFamily<BR/>
	  Vaguely like the weight field, but takes all stylistic varients not just
	  weight.<BR/>
	  This might be "Bold", "Italic", "Bold Italic", "SemiBold", "Condensed",
	  ...<BR/>
	  Whatever is appropriate for your font.
	<LI>
	  Fullname<BR/>
	  This corresponds to the "Name for humans"
	<LI>
	  Copyright
      </UL>
      <P>
      Generally FontForge will set all these fields appropriately (ie. same as
      in the Names pane). If you don't like the name ff chooses you can disassociate
      it from the PS name by right clicking on the entry and choosing from the
      popup menu. 
	<HR width="50%">
      Further complicating things, there are fields
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  WWS Family
	<LI>
	  WWS SubFamily
      </UL>
      <P>
      I don't really understand why these are needed, but MicroSoft thinks they
      are. As far as I can tell they should (in most cases) be the same as Family
      and SubFamily above, and should therefore be omitted. 
	<HR width="50%">
      CID fontname should be ignored unless you are building a CID keyed font (which
      usually means you are working on a CJK font). 
	<HR width="50%">
      Compatible Fullname<BR/>
      Is another name I don't see the need for. I think it should be the same as
      Fullname, and should be omitted. 
	<HR width="50%">
      TTF Names may be specified in more than one language and writing system.
      The entry which is translated most frequently is SubFamily. So for an Italic
      font, you would have an English entry "Italic", and perhaps
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  French, Italique
	<LI>
	  German, Kursiv
	<LI>
	  Dutch, Cursief

    <DD>
      Some truetype fonts (kaiu and mingliu are examples) do not store the correct
      outline. Instead they rely on using the instructions to move points around
      to generate the outline. The outline does not appear to be grid-fit at all,
      just positioned. FontForge will not process the instructions as it reads
      the font. In most fonts this would be the wrong thing to do, and I don't

    <DD>
      For some reason Unicode has unified greek and latin accents even though they
      don't look at all alike. When FontForge follows the simplistic unicode
      definitions it will probably pick a latin accent for greek glyphs. Fortunately
      Unicode also contains code points for the greek accents starting around U+1FBD,
      if you fill these code points with the appropriate accents then FontForge
      will use these rather than the latin accents.

    <DD>
      One of your stems is a little taller than the other. FontForge centers accents
      over the tallest point on the glyph. If there are several points with the
      same height, then an average is used.
      <P>
      If you make all your stems be the same height then the accent should be properly
      centered.

      did crash. When I downloaded the source from
      <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/systems/pdftex/">pdftex</A>
      area of ctan and built it (with debug) the resultant program did not crash.

      <P>
      If you are editing large fonts, FontForge may run out of memory. All too
      often when FF runs out of memory, the kernel will crash rather than report
      an error condition. FontForge does check for failure to allocate and attempts
      to free up some chunks of memory when the system returns an error -- I've
      never seen this code activated though.
      <P>
      FontForge does provide a mechanism which might help you avoid this. FontForge
      generally wastes a lot of memory keeping undoes around. You can clear undoes
      associated with a glyph with the Edit-&gt;Remove Undoes command. You can
      also limit the number of undoes that will be stored with each glyph with
