    workmanship. There is nothing on earth more exquisite than a bonny book,
    with well-placed columns of rich black writing in beautiful borders, and

  <P>
  First create a new font with the <CODE>New</CODE> command in the
  <CODE>File</CODE> menu (or by using the <KBD>-new</KBD> argument at startup).
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="newfont.png" WIDTH="419" HEIGHT="189">
  <P>
  Give the font a name with the <CODE><A HREF="fontinfo.html">Font
  Info</A></CODE> command from the <CODE>Element</CODE> menu. You use this
  same command to set the copyright message and change the ascent and descent
  (the sum of these two determines the size of the em square for the font,
  and by convention is 1000 for postscript fonts, a power of two (often 2048
  or 4096) for truetype fonts and 15,000 for Ikarus fonts). <SMALL>(Also if
  you are planning on making a truetype font you might want to check the Quadratic
  Splines checkbox to use the native truetype format. Editing is a little more
  difficult in this mode though)</SMALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="fontinfo.png" WIDTH="602" HEIGHT="534">
  <P>
  You may also wish to use Encoding-&gt;Reencode to change what characters
  are available in your font. FontForge generally creates new fonts with an
  ISO-8859-1, which contains (most of) the characters needed for Western Europe
  (the latin letters, some accented letters, digits, and symbols).
  <H2>
    <A NAME="CharCreate">Creating a glyph</A>
  </H2>
  <P>
  Once you have done that you are ready to start editing glyphs. Double click
  on the entry for "C" in the font view above. You should now have an empty
  Outline Glyph window:
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="C1.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
  <P>
  The outline glyph window contains two palettes snuggled up on the left side
  of the window. The top palette contains a set of editing tools, and the bottom
  palette controls which layers of the window are visible or editable.
  <P>
  The foreground layer contains the outline that will become part of the font.
  The background layer can contain images or line drawings that help you draw
  this particular glyph. The guide layer contains lines that are useful on
  a font-wide basis (such as the x-height). Currently all layers are empty.
  <P>
  This window also shows the glyph's internal coordinate system with the x
  and y axes drawn in light grey. A line representing the glyph's advance width
  is drawn in black at the right edge of the window. FontForge assigns an advance
  width of one em (in PostScript that will usually be 1000 units) to the advance
  width of a new glyph.
  <P>
  Select the Import command from the File menu and import an image of the glyph
  you are creating. It will be scaled so that it is as high as the em-square.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="C2.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
  <P>
  Select the background layer as editable from the layers palette, move the
  mouse pointer to one of the edges of the image, hold down the shift key,
  depress and drag the corner until the image is a reasonable size, then move
  the pointer onto the dark part of the image, depress the mouse and drag until
  the image is properly positioned.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="C3.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
  <P>
  If you have downloaded the
  <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/">autotrace program</A>
  you can invoke <CODE>Element-&gt;AutoTrace</CODE> to generate an outline
  from the image. But if you have not you must add points yourself. Change
  the active layer to be the foreground, and go to the tools palette and select
  the round (or curve) point. Then move the pointer to the edge of the image
  and add a point. I find that it is best to add points at places where the
  curve is horizontal or vertical, at corners, or where the curve changes
  inflection (A change of inflection occurs in a curve like "S" where the curve
  changes from being open to the left to being open on the right. If you follow
  these rules hinting will work better.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="C4.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
  <P>
  It is best to enter a curve in a clockwise fashion, so the next point should
  be added up at the top of the image on the flat section. Because the shape
  becomes flat here, a curve point is not appropriate, rather a tangent point
  is (this looks like a little triangle on the tools palette). A tangent point
  makes a nice transition from curves to straight lines because the curve leaves
  the point with the same slope the line had when it entered.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="C5.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
  <P>
  At the moment this "curve" doesn't match the image at all, don't worry about
  that we'll fix it later, and anyway it will change on its own as we continue.
  Note that we now have a control point attached to the tangent point (the
  little blue x). The next point needs to go where the image changes direction
  abruptly. Neither a curve nor a tangent point is appropriate here, instead
  we must use a corner point (one of the little squares on the tools palette).
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="C6.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
  <P>
  As you see the old curve now follows the image a bit more closely. We continue
  adding points until we are ready to close the path.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="C7.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
  <P>
  Then we close the path just by adding a new point on top of the old start
  point
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="C8.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
  <P>
  Now we must make the curve track the image more closely, to do this we must
  adjust the control points (the blue "x"es). To make all the control points
  visible select the pointer tool and double-click on the curve and then move
  the control points around until the curve looks right.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="C9.png" WIDTH="266" HEIGHT="279">
  <P>
  Finally we set width. Again with the pointer tool, move the mouse to the
  width line on the right edge of the screen, depress and drag the line back
  to a reasonable location.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="C10.png" WIDTH="266" HEIGHT="279">
  <P>
  And we are done with this glyph.
  <P>
  If you are mathematically inclined you may be interested in the coordinates
  that fontforge shows in the upper left of the window. Generally you can draw
  glyphs quite happily without bothering about these, but for those who are
  interested here is some basic info:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      Each glyph has its own coordinate system.
    <LI>
      The vertical origin is the font's baseline (the line on which most latin
      letters rest)
    <LI>
      The horizontal origin is the place where drawing the glyph will commence.
      In the example above what gets drawn initially is empty space, that is fairly
      common, and that empty space (the distance from the origin to the left edge
      of the glyph) is called the left side bearing.
    <LI>
      The units of the coordinate system are determined by the em-size of the font.
      This is the sum of the font's ascent and descent. In the example above the
      font's ascent is 800 and descent is 200, and the ascent line (the one just
      above the top of the "C") is 800 units from the baseline, while the descent
      line is 200 units below.
    <LI>
      So a position of 282,408 (as above) means that the cursor is 282 units right
      of the horizontal origin and 408 units above the baseline (or halfway between
      baseline and ascent).

    <A NAME="Navigating">Navigating to glyphs.</A>
  </H2>
  <P>
  The font view provides one way of navigating around the glyphs in a font.
  Simple scroll around it until you find the glyph you need and then double
  click on it to open a window looking at that glyph.
  <P>
  Typing a glyph will move to that glyph.
  <P>
  However some fonts are huge (Chinese, Japanese and Korean fonts have thousands
  or even tens of thousands of glyphs) and scrolling around the font view is
  a an inefficient way of finding your glyph. <CODE>View-&gt;Goto </CODE>provides
  a simple dialog which will allow you to move directly to any glyph for which
  you know the name (or encoding). If your font is a Unicode font, then this
  dialog will also allow you to find glyphs by block name (ie. Hebrew rather
  than Alef).
  <P>
  The simplest way to navigate is just to go to the next or previous glyph.
  And <CODE>View-&gt;Next Char</CODE> and <CODE>View-&gt;Prev Char</CODE> will
  do exactly that.
  <H2>
    <A NAME="Creating-o">Creating </A>the letter "o" -- consistent directions
  </H2>
  <P>
  In the previous example the bitmap of the letter filled the canvas of the
  image. And when FontForge imported the image it needed to be scaled once
  in the program. But usually when you create the image of the letter you have
  some idea of how much white space there should be around it. If your images
  are exactly one em high then FontForge will scale them automatically to be
  the right size. So in the following examples all the images have exactly
  the right amount of white-space around them to fit perfectly in an em.
  <P>
  For the next example double click on the square in the font view that should
  contain "o", and import "o_Ambrosia.png" into it.
  <TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">

    </TR>
  </TABLE>
  <P>
  Notice that the first outline is drawn clockwise and the second
  counter-clockwise. This change in drawing direction is important. Both PostScript
  and TrueType require that the outer boundary of a glyph be drawn in a certain
  direction (they happen to be opposite from each other, which is a mild
  annoyance), within FontForge all outer boundaries must be drawn clockwise,
  while all inner boundaries must be drawn counter-clockwise.
  <P>
  If you fail to alternate directions between outer and inner boundaries you
  may get results like the one on the left
  <IMG SRC="o-baddir.png" WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="28">. If you fail to draw the
  outer contour in a clockwise fashion the errors are more subtle, but will
  generally result in a less pleasing result once the glyph has been rasterized.
  <P>
  <SMALL><STRONG>TECHNICAL AND CONFUSING</STRONG>: the exact behavior of
  rasterizers varies. Early PostScript rasterizers used a "non-zero winding
  number rule" while more recent ones use an "even-odd" rule. TrueType uses
  the "non-zero" rule. The description given above is for the "non-zero" rule.
  The "even-odd" rule would fill the "o" correctly no matter which way the
  paths were drawn (though there would probably be subtle problems with
  hinting).</SMALL>
  <P>
  <SMALL>Filling using the <A NAME="even-odd">even-odd </A>rules that a line
  is drawn from the current pixel to infinity (in any direction) and the number
  of contour crossings is counted. If this number is even the pixel is not
  filled. If the number is odd the pixel is filled. In the
  <A NAME="non-zero">non-zero </A>winding number rule the same line is drawn,
  contour crossings in a clockwise direction add 1 to the crossing count,
  counter-clockwise contours subtract 1. If the result is 0 the pixel is not
  filled, any other result will fill it.</SMALL>
  <P>
  The command <CODE><A HREF="elementmenu.html#Correct">Element-&gt;Correct
  Direction</A></CODE> will look at each selected contour, figure out whether
  it qualifies as an outer or inner contour and will reverse the drawing direction
  when the contour is drawn incorrectly. 
    <HR>
  <H2>
    <A NAME="consistent-stems">Creating </A>letters with consistent stem widths,
    serifs and heights.
  </H2>
  <P>
  Many Latin (Greek, Cyrillic) fonts have serifs, special terminators at the
  end of stems. And in almost all LGC fonts there should only be a small number
  of stem widths used (ie. the vertical stem of "l" and "i" should probably
  be the same).
  <P>
  FontForge does not have a good way to enforce consistency, but it does have
  various commands to help you check for it, and to find discrepancies.
  <P>
  Let us start with the letter "l" and go through the familiar process of importing
  a bitmap and defining it's outline.

    <A NAME="accents">Building</A> accented glyphs
  </H2>
  <P>
  Latin, Greek and Cyrillic all have a large complement of accented glyphs.
  FontForge provides several ways to build accented glyphs out of base glyphs.
  <P>
  The most obvious mechanism is simple copy and paste:
  <A HREF="editmenu.html#Copy">Copy</A> the letter "A" and
  <A HREF="editmenu.html#Paste">Paste</A> it to "&Atilde;" then
  <A HREF="editmenu.html#Copy">copy</A> the tilde accent and
  <A HREF="editmenu.html#PasteInto">Paste it Into</A> "&Atilde;" (note Paste
  Into is subtly different from Paste. Paste clears out the glyph before pasting,
  while Paste Into merges what was in the glyph with the what is in the clipboard).
  Then you open up "&Atilde;" and position the accent so that it appears properly
  centered over the A.
  <P>
  This mechanism is not particularly efficient, if you change the shape of
  the letter "A" you will need to regenerate all the accented glyphs built
  from it. FontForge has the concept of a
  <A HREF="overview.html#References">Reference</A> to a glyph. So you can Copy
  a Reference to "A", and Paste it, the Copy a Reference to tilde and Paste
  it Into, and then again adjust the position of the accent over the A.
  <P>
  Then if you change the shape of the A the shape of the A in "&Atilde;" will
  be updated automagically -- as will the width of "&Atilde;".
  <P>
  But FontForge knows that "&Atilde;" is built out of "A" and the tilde accent,
  and it can easily create your accented glyphs itself by placing the references
  in "&Atilde;" and then positioning the accent over the "A". (The Unicode
  consortium provides a database which lists the components of every accented
  glyph in Unicode and FontForge uses this).
  <P>
  As an example, open the file: tutorial/Ambrosia.sfd, then select all the
  glyphs at encodings 0xc0-0xff, and then press
  <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Accented">Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Build Accented</A>
  all the accented glyphs will magically appear (there are a few glyphs in
  this range which are not accented, and they will remain blank).
  <P>
  FontForge has a heuristic for positioning accents (most accents are centered
  over the highest point of the glyph), sometimes this will produce bad results
  (if the one of the two stems of "u" is slightly taller than the other the
  accent will be placed over it rather than being centered over the glyph),
  so you should be prepared to look at your accented glyphs after creating
  them. You may need to adjust one or two (or you may even want to redesign
  your base glyphs slightly).
  <H2>
    <A NAME="ligature">Creating</A> a ligature
  </H2>
  <P>
  Unicode contains a number of ligature glyphs (in latin we have: &AElig;,
  OE, fi, etc. while in arabic there are hundreds). Again Unicode provides
  a database listing the components of each standard ligature.
  <P>
  FontForge cannot create a nice ligature for you, but what it can do is put
  all the components of the ligature into the glyph with
  <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Accented">Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Build Composite</A>.
  This makes it slightly easier (at least in latin) to design a ligature.

      <TD>Use the <A HREF="elementmenu.html#CharInfo">Element -&gt; Glyph Info</A>

    </TR>
  </TABLE>
  <P>
  Some word processors will allow the editing caret to be placed inside a ligature
  (with a caret position between each component of the ligature). This means
  that the user of that word processor does not need to know s/he is dealing
  with a ligature and sees behavior very similar to what s/he would see if
  the components were present. But if the word processor is to be able to do
  this it must have some information from the font designer giving the locations
  of appropriate caret positions. As soon as FontForge notices that a glyph
  is a ligature it will insert in it enough caret location lines to fit between
  the ligature's components. FontForge places these on the origin, if you leave
  them on the origin FontForge will ignore them. But once you have built your
  ligature you might want to move the pointer tool over to the origin line,
  press the button and drag one of the caret lines to its correct location.
  (Only Apple Advanced Typography and OpenType support this).
  <P>
  There are a good many ligatures needed for the indic scripts, but Unicode
  does not provide an encoding for them. If you wish to build a ligature that
  is not part of Unicode you may do so. First <A HREF="faq.html#new-name">add
  an unencoded glyph to your font</A> (or if your font is a Unicode font, you
  could use a code point in the private use area), and name the glyph. The
  name is important, if you name it correctly FontForge will be able to figure
  out that it is a ligature and what its components are. If you want to build
  a ligature out of the glyphs "longs", "longs" and "l" then name it
  "longs_longs_l", if you want to build a ligature out of Unicode 0D15, 0D4D
  and 0D15 then name it "uni0D15_uni0D4D_uni0D15".
  <P>
  Once you have named your ligature, and inserted its components (with Build
  Composite), you probably want to open the glyph,
  <A HREF="editmenu.html#Unlink">Unlink your References</A> and edit them to
  make a pleasing shape (as above).
  <H2>
    <A NAME="lookups">Lookups and Features</A>
  </H2>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="fontinfo-lookups.png" WIDTH="602" HEIGHT="534" ALIGN="Right">Unfortunately
  simply creating a ligature glyph is not enough. You must also include information
  in the font to say that the glyph is a ligature, and to say what components
  it is built from.
  <P>
  In OpenType this is handled by lookups and features. A lookup is a collection
  of tables in the font which contain transformation information. A feature
  is a collection of lookups and is a provides semantic information to the
  world outside the font about what that set of lookups can be expected to
  do. So in the example above the lookup would contain the information that
  "f" + "f" + "i" should turn into "ffi", while the feature would say that
  this is a standard ligature for the latin script.
  <P>
  So the first time you create a ligature glyph you will need to create a lookup
  (and a lookup subtable) in which the information for that glyph will reside.
  Any subsequent ligatures can probably share the same lookup and subtable.
  <P>
  (This may seem like overkill for latin ligatures, and perhaps it is, bt the
  complexity is needed for more complex writing systems).
  <P>
  You would open the Lookups pane of the
  <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Lookups">Element-&gt;FontInfo</A> command and press
  the <CODE>[Add Lookup] </CODE>button. This will give you a new dialog in
  which you can fill in the attributes of your new lookup.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="AddLookup-Liga.png" WIDTH="439" HEIGHT="427" ALIGN="Left">You must
  first choose the lookup type. For ligatures this should be "Ligature
  Substitution". You may then bind this lookup to a feature, script and language
  set. The "ffi" ligature is a standard ligature in latin typesetting so it
  should be bound to the 'liga' tag, and the 'latn' script. (If you click on
  the little box to the right of "liga" you will get a pulldown list of the
  so-called "friendly names" for the features. "liga" corresponds to "Standard
  Ligatures").
  <P>
  The language is a bit tricky. This ligature should probably be active for
  all languages except Turkish that use the latin script (Turkish uses a dotlessi
  and it is not clear whether the "i" in the "fi" and "ffi" ligatures has a
  dot over it). So we want to list all languages but Turkish. That's a lot
  of languages. The convention instead is that if a language isn't mentioned
  explicitly anywhere in the font then that language will be treated as the
  "default" language. So to make this feature not be active for Turkish, we'd
  have to create some other feature which specifically mentioned Turkish in
  its language list.
  <P>
  Underneath the feature list is a set of flags. In latin ligatures none of
  these flags need be set. In Arabic one might want to set both "Right to Left"
  and "Ignore Combining Marks".
  <P>
  Next the lookup must be given a name. This name is for your use and will
  never be seen in the real font. The name must be distinct from the name of
  any other lookup however.
  <P>
  Finally you get to decide whether you want the ligatures in this lookup to
  be stored in afm files.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="subtable-ffi.png" WIDTH="421" HEIGHT="215" ALIGN="Right">Once you
  have created a lookup, you must create a subtable in that lookup. Select
  the lookup line (in the Lookups pane of Font Info) and press <CODE>[Add
  Subtable]</CODE>. This is a fairly simple dialog... you simply provide a
  name for the sub-table, and then another dialog will pop up and you will
  (finally) be able to store your ligature information.
  <P>
  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><BIG>CAVEAT: </BIG></STRONG></FONT>OpenType engines
  will only apply features which they believe are appropriate for the current
  script (in Latin scripts, Uniscribe will apply 'liga'). Even worse, some
  applications may choose not to apply any features ever (Word does not do
  ligatures in latin -- though this may have changed with the 2007 release?).
  <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/specs/default.htm">Microsoft

  </H2>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="sidebearings.png" WIDTH="111" HEIGHT="191" ALIGN="Right">After
  you have created the shapes of your glyphs you must next figure out the spacing
  between glyphs. The space between any two glyph has two components, the space
  after the first glyph, and the space before the second glyph. In a left to
  right world these two are called the right side bearing and the left side
  bearing respectively.
  <P>
  The left side bearing may be changed by the simple expedient of
  <CODE>Edit-&gt;Select All</CODE> (in the outline view) and then dragging
  the selected objects to the appropriate place. The right side bearing may
  be changed by selecting the advance width line and adjusting it
  appropriately.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  However it is generally better not to set the metrics of a single glyph in
  isolation, you should see the glyph in the context of other glyphs and set
  it from that perspective. Use the <CODE>Window-&gt;Open
  <A HREF="metricsview.html">Metrics Window </A></CODE>command.<BR>
  <IMG SRC="MetricsView.png" WIDTH="479" HEIGHT="331"><BR>
  Any glyphs selected in the fontview (when you invoke the metrics view) will
  be displayed in the metrics view. You may change which glyphs are displayed
  by either typing new ones in to the text field at the top of the view, or
  by dragging a glyph from the fontview.
  <P>
  From here you may adjust any glyph's metrics by typing into the textfields
  below it, or you may select a glyph (by clicking on its image) and drag it
  around (to adjust the left side bearing), or drag its width line (to adjust
  its right side bearing).
  <P>
  If you want to generate a "typewriter" style font (where all glyphs have
  the same width) execute an <CODE>Edit-&gt;Select All</CODE> from the fontview
  and then <CODE>Metrics-&gt;Set Width</CODE>. This will set the widths of
  all glyphs to the same value. After doing that you might also want to execute
  <CODE>Metrics-&gt;Center in Width</CODE> to even out the left and right spacing
  on each glyph.
  <P>
  <I><IMG SRC="autowidth.png" WIDTH="276" HEIGHT="268" ALIGN="Right"></I>If
  all this manual operation seems too complicated, try

    <A NAME="Vertical">Vertical</A> Metrics

  FontForge provides some support for the vertical metrics needed for CJK fonts.
  First you must tell FontForge that this font should contain vertical metrics,
  do this with <CODE>Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;General-&gt;Has Vertical
  Metrics</CODE>. Then in each outline glyph enable VMetrics in the Layers
  palette.
  <P>
  You should now see a vertical advance line somewhere underneath your glyph.
  You may drag this line just as you would the horizontal advance (width) line.

    Setting the <A NAME="baseline">baseline</A> to baseline spacing of a font.

      In a PostScript Type1 font (or bare CFF font)
    <DD>
      There is no way to set this value.<BR>
      At all, ever.<BR>
      In traditional typography the inter-line spacing is 1em (which in FontForge
      is the ascent+descent of a font). Some applications will use this. Other
      applications will use the font's bounding box (summing the maximum ascender
      height with the minimum descender depth) -- a very bad, but very common approach.
    <DT>
      In a TrueType or OpenType font
    <DD>
      Unfortunately this depends on the platform
      <DL>
	<DT>
	  Mac
	<DD>
	  On a mac the baseline to baseline spacing is determined again by the bounding
	  box values of the font, specified in the 'hhea' table, possibly modified
	  by a linegap (Which you can set in FontForge with
	  <A HREF="fontinfo.html">Element-&gt;FontInfo-&gt;OS/2</A>.
	<DT>
	  On Windows
	<DD>
	  According to the OpenType spec, the baseline to baseline distance is set
	  by the values of Typographic Ascent and Descent of the 'OS/2' table. These
	  can be set with
	  <A HREF="fontinfo.html">Element-&gt;FontInfo-&gt;OS/2</A>, but are usually
	  allowed to default to the Ascent and Descent values of FontForge -- they
	  generally sum to 1em and are equivalent to the traditional unleaded
	  default.<BR>
	  Again this may be modified by a linegap field.<BR>
	  Unfortunately Windows programs rarely follow the standard (which I expect
	  doesn't supprise anyone), and generally they will use the font's bounding
	  box as specified in the Win Ascent/Descent fields of the 'OS/2' table.
	<DT>
	  On linux/unix
	<DD>
	  I doubt there is any standard behavior. Unix apps will probably choose one
	  of the above.
      </DL>

  Typographically ept applications will allow users to adjust baseline to baseline
  spacing, so the default value may not be all that relevant.

    <A NAME="Kerning">Kerning</A>
  </H2>
  <P>
  If you are careful in setting the left and right side-bearings you can design
  your font so that the spacing looks nice in almost all cases. But there are
  always some cases which confound simple solutions.
  <P>
  Consider "<FONT FACE="helvetica">To</FONT>" or
  "<FONT FACE="helvetica">Av</FONT>" here the standard choices are inappropriate.
  The "<FONT FACE="helvetica">o</FONT>" will look better if it can slide more
  to the left and snuggle under the top bar of the
  "<FONT FACE="helvetica">T</FONT>". This is called kerning, and it is used
  to control inter-glyph spacing on a pair-by-pair basis.
  <TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
    <CAPTION>

  <P>
  <IMG SRC="addlookup-kern.png" WIDTH="439" HEIGHT="408" ALIGN="Right">In the

  on the right glyph of the pair, the line (normally the horizontal advance)
  between the two should go green (and becomes the kerned advance). Drag this
  line around until the spacing looks nice.
  <P>
  Sadly that statement is a simplification... Before you can create a kerning
  pair you must create a kerning lookup (see
  <A HREF="editexample4.html#lookups">the section on lookups</A>). Once again
  you bring up the Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Lookups pane and this time you
  must select the GPOS (Glyph Positioning) tab at the top of the pane. Once
  again you press <CODE>[Add Lookup]</CODE>. This time the lookup type is "Pairwise
  Positioning", and the feature is "kern" (or perhaps "vkrn" if you want to
  do vertical kerning).
  <P>
  Once you have created your lookup you again select it and press the [Add
  Subtable] button (which asks you to name the subtable). Then FontForge will
  ask you whether you want a subtable of kerning pairs or kerning classes.
  <P>
  If you have many glyphs which have similar kerning features you might wish
  to create a set of <A HREF="metricsview.html#kernclass">kerning classes</A>
  (which might say that A, &Agrave;, &Aacute;, &Acirc;, &Acirc;, &Atilde; and
  &Auml; all kern alike). However for this example you want a kerning pair
  subtable.<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="subtable-to.png" WIDTH="415" HEIGHT="441" ALIGN="Left">Then FontForge
  will popup a dialog allowing you to set the kerning subtable directly. You
  may set your kerning pairs from here, though I prefer the metrics view myself
  because you can see more glyphs and so get a better feel for the "color"
  of the font.
  <P>

  the letters)

  <P>
  FontForge has equivalent support for vertical kerning. It can read and write
  vertical kerning information from and to truetype, opentype and svg fonts.
  It allows you to create vertical kerning classes. The metrics window has
  a vertical mode in which you can set vertical kerning pairs. Finally it has
  a command which will copy horizontal kerning information to the vertically
  rotated glyphs (That is, if the combination "A" "V" is horizontally kerned
  by -200, then "A.vert" "V.vert" should be vertically kerned by -200.
  <P>
  (Vertical kerning is only available if the font has vertical metrics)

  <H2>
    <A NAME="Variants">Glyph</A> Variants
  </H2>
  <P>
  In many scripts glyphs have several variant glyphs. In latin the most obvious
  example is that every letter has both an upper case and a lower case variant.
  A more esoteric example would be that in renaissance times the long-s variant
  (of s) was used initially and medially in a word, while the short-s was only
  used at the end of a word.
  <P>
  Most Arabic glyphs have four variants (initial, medial, final and isolated).
  <P>
  The digits often have several variants: tabular digits (where all digits
  have the same advance width so that tables of numbers don't look ragged),
  proportional digits (where each digit has a width appropriate to its shape)
  and old-style or lower case digits
  (<IMG SRC="lcdigits.png" WIDTH="76" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="Middle">) where some
  digits have descenders and others have ascenders.
  <P>
  Some of these variants are built into the encodings (the upper and lower
  case distinction is), but in other cases you should provide extra information
  in the font so that the word processor can be aware of the variants (Arabic
  is midway between the two, the various forms are in the encoding, but you
  need to provide extra information as well).
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="subtable-oldstyle.png" WIDTH="421" HEIGHT="287" ALIGN="Right">Let
  us consider the case of the digits mentioned above. Assume that the glyph
  called "one" contains the tabular variant of one, the glyph "one.prop" contains
  the proportional variant and "one.oldstyle" contains the lower-case variant,
  and so on for all the other digits. Before you do anything else you must
  create two <A HREF="editexample4.html#lookups">lookups</A> and associated
  subtables (I shan't go into that again. Here the lookup type is "Single
  Substitution", and the features are "pnum" for Proportional Numbers and "onum"
  for Oldstyle Figures. Also the digits aren't in any single script, but are
  in many, so make this feature apply to multiple scripts (including "DFLT").
  <P>
  When FontForge brings up the dialog to fill in the oldstyle lookup subtable
  notice that there is a button [Default Using Suffix:] followed by a text
  field containing a suffix. Set the text field to "oldstyle" and press the
  button. It will search through all glyphs in all the scripts of the feature
  and find any "oldstyle" variants of them and populate the table with them.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="glyphinfo-one.png" WIDTH="431" HEIGHT="310" ALIGN="Left">Sometimes
  it makes more sense to think of all the substitutions available for a specific
  glyph (rather than all substitutions in a specific lookup). So instead if
  filling up the subtable dialog for "Proportional Numbers" let us instead
  select "one" from the fontview,
  <CODE><A HREF="charinfo.html#substitution">Element-&gt;Glyph Info</A></CODE>,
  select the <CODE>Substitutions</CODE> tab and press the <CODE>&lt;New&gt;
  </CODE>button.
  <P>

  this. You need to be creating an OpenType or TrueType font for these variants
  to be output).
  <H3>
    <A NAME="Conditional">Conditional</A> Variants
  </H3>
  <P>
  FontForge supports OpenType's Contextual Substitution and Chaining Contextual
  Substitution sub-tables, and to a lesser extent, Apple's contextual glyph
  substitution sub-table. This means that you can insert conditional variants
  into your font. <A HREF="editexample6-5.html#Conditional">The next page</A>
  will go into this in greater detail.
  <H2>
    <A NAME="Marks">Anchoring</A> marks
  </H2>
  <P>
  Some scripts (Arabic, Hebrew) need vowel marks placed around the main text
  glyphs. Other scripts (some variants of Latin and Greek) have so many possible
  accent combinations that having preassembled glyphs for all combinations
  is unwieldy.
  <P>
  In OpenType (which includes MicroSoft's TrueType fonts) it is possible to
  indicate on all base glyphs where marks should attach, and on all marks where
  the base glyphs should attach. Thus one could put an anchor centered above
  a lowercase-a indicating that all accents (acute, grave, umlaut, circumflex,
  tilde, macron, ring, caron, ...) should attach there, and underneath all
  the accents one could put another anchor so that when the two glyphs are
  adjacent in the text the word-processor will know where to place the accent
  so that it rides above the "a".

    <TR>
      <TD><IMG SRC="a_with_anchor.png" WIDTH=104 HEIGHT=208></TD>

    </TR>
  </TABLE>
  <P>
  Not all accents ride centered above the letter (the dot and ogonek ride below
  the letter), so you may need more than one anchor for different styles of
  attachment.
  <P>
  Finally some letters can have multiple attachments, unicode U+1EA4, for example,
  is an A with a circumflex and an acute. Normally the circumflex and the acute
  will attach at the same point, which would be ugly and confusing. Instead
  we create a different kind of anchor, a mark to mark anchor, on the circumflex
  and allow the acute accent to attach to that.
  <P>
  Before one can create an anchor in a glyph one must (of course) create a
  lookup and subtable. This is another Glyph Positioning lookup (so you enter
  it in the GPOS pane). Once you have created the subtable you will be presented
  with another dialog asking for anchor classes, you must create an
  <A HREF="overview.html#Anchors">anchor class</A> for each type of attachment
  (thus in the case of A above with two types of attachments (one above and
  one below) you would create two anchor classes.
  <P>
  Then for each glyph in which an attachment will be made, you should first
  click at the point where the anchor is to be created and then bring up the
  <CODE><A HREF="pointmenu.html#AddAnchor">Point-&gt;Add Anchor</A></CODE>
  dialog.
  <P>
  You can examine (and correct) how a glyph fits to any others that combine
  with it by using the
  <CODE><A HREF="viewmenu.html#AnchorControl">View-&gt;Anchor
  Control...</A></CODE> command.

    <A NAME="Conditional">Conditional</A> Features
  </H2>
  <P>
  OpenType and Apple fonts both provide contextual features. These are features
  which only take place in a given context and are essential for typesetting
  Indic and Arabic scripts. In OpenType a context is specified by a set of
  patterns that are tested against the glyph stream of a document. If a pattern
  matches then any substitutions it defines will be applied. In an Apple font,
  the context is specified by a state machine -- a mini program which parses
  and transforms the glyph stream.
  <P>
  Conditional features may involve substitutions, ligatures or kerning (and
  some more obscure behaviors). First I shall provide an example of a contextual
  substitution, later of <A HREF="editexample6-5.html#Greek">contextual
  ligatures</A>.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="bed-script.png" WIDTH="259" HEIGHT="81" ALIGN="Right">Instead of
  an Indic or Arabic example, let us take something I'm more familiar with,
  the problem of typesetting a latin script font where the letters ``b,'' ``o,''
  ``v'' and ``w'' join their following letter near the x-height, while all
  other letters join near the baseline. Thus we need two variants for each
  glyph, one that joins (on the left) at the baseline (the default variant)
  and one which joins at the x-height. Let us call this second set of letters
  the ``high'' letters and name them ``a.high,'' ``b.high'' and so forth.

  We divide the set of possible glyphs into three classes: the letters ``bovw'',
  all other letters, and all other glyphs. We need to create two patterns,
  the first will match a glyph in the ``bovw'' class followed by another glyph
  in the ``bovw'' class, while the second will match a glyph in the ``bovw''
  class followed by any other letter. If either of these matches the second
  glyph should be transformed into its high variant.

  </UL>
  <P>
  (You might wonder why I don't just have a class of all letters and use one
  rule instead of two? Because in this case all my classes must be disjoint,
  I mayn't have one glyph appearing in two classes).
  <P>
  The first thing we must do is create a simple substitution mapping each low
  letter to its high variant. This is a "Simple Substitution" lookup, but it
  will not be attached to any feature, instead it will be invoked by a contextual
  lookup. Let us call this lookup "high". We must (of course) create a subtable
  to go with our lookup, and we can use the [Default with Suffix:] button to
  fill it up with the high variants.
  <P>
  The tricky part is defining the context. This is done by defining yet another
  lookup, a contextual chaining lookup which should be associated with a 'calt'
  feature. And of course we want an associated subtable). This will pop up
  a series of dialogs to edit a contextual subtable
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="ott2_5.png" WIDTH="329" HEIGHT="263" ALIGN="Left">The first dialog
  allows you to specify the overall format of the substitution. We want a class

  be.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="ott3.png" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="357" ALIGN="Right">The next dialog
  finally shows something interesting. At the top are a series of patterns
  to match and substitutions that will be applied if the string matches. Underneath
  that are the glyph classes that this substitution uses. A contextual chaining
  dialog divides the glyph stream into three categories: those glyphs before
  the current glyph (these are called backtracking glyphs), the current glyph
  itself (you may specify more than one), and this (these) glyphs may have
  simple substitutions applied to them, and finally glyphs after the current
  glyph (these are called lookahead glyphs).
  <P>
  Each category of glyphs may divide glyphs into a different set of classes,
  but in this example we use the same classes for all categories (this makes
  it easier to convert the substitution to Apple's format). The first line
  (in the ``List of lists'' field) should be read thus: If a backtracking glyph
  (the glyph before the current one) in class 1 is followed by the current
  glyph in class 2, then location 0 --the only location -- in the match string
  (that is the current glyph) should have simple substitution `high' applied
  to it.
  <P>
  If you look at the glyph class definitions you will see that class 1 includes
  those glyphs which must be followed by a high variant, so this seems reasonable.
  <P>
  The second line is similar except that it matches glyphs in class 1. Looking
  at the class definitions we see that classes 1 &amp; 2 include all the letters,
  so these two lines mean that if any letter follows one of ``bovw'' then that
  letter should be converted to its `high' variant. <BR CLEAR=ALL>

  Apple specifies a context with a finite state machine, which is essentially
  a tiny program that looks at the glyph stream and decides what substitutions
  to apply. Each state machine has a set of glyph class definitions (just as
  in the OpenType example), and a set of states. The process begins in state
  0 at the start of the glyph stream. The computer determines what class the
  current glyph is in and then looks at the current state to see how it will
  behave when given input from that class. The behavior includes the ability
  to change to a different state, advancing the input to the next glyph, applying
  a substitution to either the current glyph or a previous one (the ``marked''
  glyph).
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="sm-picture.png" WIDTH="386" HEIGHT="130" ALIGN="Right">Using the
  same example of a latin script font... We again need a simple substitution
  to convert each letter into its high alternate. The process is the same as
  it was for OpenType, and indeed we can use the same substitution. Again we
  divide the glyphs into three classes (Apple gives us some extra classes whether
  we want them or no, but conceptually we use the same three classes as in
  the OpenType example). We want a state machine with two states (again Apple
  gives us an extra state for free, but we shall ignore that), one is the start
  state (the base state -- where nothing changes), and the other is the state

  Greek has a character (U+03D7) which is equivalent to the Latin ampersand.
  Just as the ampersand is (originally) a ligature of "E" and "t", so U+03D7
  is a ligature of "kappa" and "iota". However this ligature should only be
  used if "kappa" and "iota" make up a word unto themselves, it should not
  be used for more normal occurances of the two within a longer word.

  <IMG SRC="kappa_iota-lookup.png" WIDTH="239" HEIGHT="315" ALIGN="Right">So

  These rules will be executed in order, and the first one that matches the

      will match the first rule above (it contains letters before the kappa iota

    <LI>
      The second string, <IMG SRC="kappaiotatheta.png" WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="12">,

    <LI>
      The third string, <IMG SRC="alphakappaiotatheta.png" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="12">,
      matches all the rules, but since the search stops at the first match, only

    <LI>
      The string, <IMG SRC="spacekappaiotaspace.png" WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="12">, matches

  Well there's one main reason:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      This does not work if the kappa is at the beginning of the input stream (it

  and select the pixel sizes you want bitmaps in (Note, that on X and MS windows
  pixel sizes often do not correspond exactly to point sizes. You can then
  use the bitmap editor (<CODE><A HREF="bitmapview.html">Window-&gt;Open
  Bitmap</A></CODE>) to clean up the bitmaps, or you can generate your bitmap
  fonts and then <A HREF="http://clr.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/download.html">use
  someone else's bitmap editor to clean them up</A>.

  <P>
  If you save your file it will be saved in a format that only FontForge
  understands (as far as I know anyway). This is not very helpful if you want
  to use the font.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="generate.png" WIDTH="406" HEIGHT="411" ALIGN="Right">Instead you
  must use <A HREF="generate.html">File-&gt;Generate</A> to convert your font
  into one of the standard font formats. FontForge presents what looks like
  a vast array of font formats, but in reality there are just several variants
  on a few basic font formats: PostScript Type 1, TrueType, OpenType (and for
  CJK fonts, also CID-keyed fonts).
  <P>
  You also have a choice of bitmap formats. FontForge supports bdf (used by
  X), mac NFNT (used by the Mac), Windows FNT (used by Windows 2.0 I think)
  and storing bitmaps inside true (or open) type wrappers.<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

  <P>
  After you have generated a font, you probably want to generate a sequence
  of similar fonts. In Latin, Greek and Cyrillic fonts italic (or oblique),
  bold, condensed, expanded styles are fairly common.
  <P>
  Fonts with different styles in the same family should share the same Family
  Name (in the <A HREF="fontinfo.html">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Names</A>
  dialog). The Font Name should be the Family Name with the style name(s) appended
  to the end, often preceded by a hyphen. So in the font family "Helvetica"
  all fonts should have the Family Name set to "Helvetica". The plain style
  could be called simply "Helvetica" or "Helvetica-Regular", the bold style
  "Helvetica-Bold", the oblique (Helvetica doesn't have a true italic)
  "Helvetica-Oblique", etc.
  <P>
  FontForge has a command (which doesn't work well yet, but I hope to improve
  eventually) <A HREF="MetaFont.html">Element-&gt;MetaFont</A> which is designed
  to help you create a bold (condensed, expanded, etc.) style from a plain
  one.
  <P>
  The
  <A HREF="transform.html">Element-&gt;Transform-&gt;Transform-&gt;Skew</A>
  command can turn a plain font into an Oblique one. Creating a true italic
  font is generally a bit more complex, the shape of the "a" changes dramatically
  to "<I>a</I>", the "f" gains a descender as "<I>f</I>", the serifs on "ilm"
  etc. become rounded as "<I>ilm</I>" and there will probably be other subtle
  differences. Also, after having skewed a font you should
  <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Add-Extrema">Element-&gt;Add Extrema</A>.
  <P>
  If you already have a "Bold" and a "Plain" style of a font (and each glyph
  has the same number of points in the same order), you can use the
  <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Interpolate">Element-&gt;Interpolate Font </A>command
  to generate a "DemiBold" style.
  <P>
  TrueType fonts (and Windows) support a very fine gradation of stem thicknesses
  (the Mac really only understands Plain and Bold). If you go to
  <A HREF="fontinfo.html#TTF-Values">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;OS/2</A> you
  can set the weight to be any value between 0 and 999 (with plain generally
  being at 400 or 500, and Bold at 700). TrueType fonts also support a range
  of widths (while the Mac only supports condensed, plain and expanded).
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="GenerateFamily.png" WIDTH="414" HEIGHT="552" ALT="Dialog for Generate Mac Family"
      ALIGN="Right">On Windows machines, as long as you get the names right, the
  system should be able to figure out what fonts go into what families. But
  on the Mac the situation is (or was, it is changing and I don't understand
  all the new extensions yet) more complicated. The Mac supports a limited
  range of styles (plain, italic, bold, outline, condensed, expanded and
  combinations of these) anything outside these must go into a separate family.
  Then a special table needs to be constructed (called the FOND) which holds
  pointers to the various fonts in the family. If you open all the fonts you
  want to be in a given family (and if they have been given the proper names)
  and then from the plain font select
  <A HREF="filemenu.html#GenerateMac">File-&gt;Generate Family</A>. This will
  list all the fonts that FontForge thinks belong to the same family as the
  current font and will allow you to generate a FOND structure as well as font
  files for all family members (sometimes all the fonts live in one file, sometimes
  they don't, it depends on the font format chosen).

  So you have made a new font. But it does you no good just sitting on your
  disk, you must install it on your machine. On some systems this is as simple
  as just dragging the new font into your system Fonts folder, but on other
  systems there is a fair amount work involved still. See the
  <A HREF="faq.html#font-install">Installing fonts FAQ</A>.
