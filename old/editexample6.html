    <A NAME="Variants">Glyph</A> Variants
  </H2>
  <P>
  In many scripts glyphs have several variant glyphs. In latin the most obvious
  example is that every letter has both an upper case and a lower case variant.
  A more esoteric example would be that in renaissance times the long-s variant
  (of s) was used initially and medially in a word, while the short-s was only
  used at the end of a word.
  <P>
  Most Arabic glyphs have four variants (initial, medial, final and isolated).
  <P>
  The digits often have several variants: tabular digits (where all digits
  have the same advance width so that tables of numbers don't look ragged),
  proportional digits (where each digit has a width appropriate to its shape)
  and old-style or lower case digits
  (<IMG SRC="lcdigits.png" WIDTH="76" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="Middle">) where some
  digits have descenders and others have ascenders.
  <P>
  Some of these variants are built into the encodings (the upper and lower
  case distinction is), but in other cases you should provide extra information
  in the font so that the word processor can be aware of the variants (Arabic
  is midway between the two, the various forms are in the encoding, but you
  need to provide extra information as well).
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="subtable-oldstyle.png" WIDTH="421" HEIGHT="287" ALIGN="Right">Let
  us consider the case of the digits mentioned above. Assume that the glyph
  called "one" contains the tabular variant of one, the glyph "one.prop" contains
  the proportional variant and "one.oldstyle" contains the lower-case variant,
  and so on for all the other digits. Before you do anything else you must
  create two <A HREF="editexample4.html#lookups">lookups</A> and associated
  subtables (I shan't go into that again. Here the lookup type is "Single
  Substitution", and the features are "pnum" for Proportional Numbers and "onum"
  for Oldstyle Figures. Also the digits aren't in any single script, but are
  in many, so make this feature apply to multiple scripts (including "DFLT").
  <P>
  When FontForge brings up the dialog to fill in the oldstyle lookup subtable
  notice that there is a button [Default Using Suffix:] followed by a text
  field containing a suffix. Set the text field to "oldstyle" and press the
  button. It will search through all glyphs in all the scripts of the feature
  and find any "oldstyle" variants of them and populate the table with them.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="glyphinfo-one.png" WIDTH="431" HEIGHT="310" ALIGN="Left">Sometimes
  it makes more sense to think of all the substitutions available for a specific
  glyph (rather than all substitutions in a specific lookup). So instead if
  filling up the subtable dialog for "Proportional Numbers" let us instead
  select "one" from the fontview,
  <CODE><A HREF="charinfo.html#substitution">Element-&gt;Glyph Info</A></CODE>,
  select the <CODE>Substitutions</CODE> tab and press the <CODE>&lt;New&gt;
  </CODE>button.
  <P>
  (Note: Type0, Type1 and Type3 PostScript fonts have no notation to handle
  this. You need to be creating an OpenType or TrueType font for these variants
  to be output).
  <H3>
    <A NAME="Conditional">Conditional</A> Variants
  </H3>
  <P>
  FontForge supports OpenType's Contextual Substitution and Chaining Contextual
  Substitution sub-tables, and to a lesser extent, Apple's contextual glyph
  substitution sub-table. This means that you can insert conditional variants
  into your font. <A HREF="editexample6-5.html#Conditional">The next page</A>
  will go into this in greater detail.
  <H2>
    <A NAME="Marks">Anchoring</A> marks
  </H2>
  <P>
  Some scripts (Arabic, Hebrew) need vowel marks placed around the main text
  glyphs. Other scripts (some variants of Latin and Greek) have so many possible
  accent combinations that having preassembled glyphs for all combinations
  is unwieldy.
  <P>
  In OpenType (which includes MicroSoft's TrueType fonts) it is possible to
  indicate on all base glyphs where marks should attach, and on all marks where
  the base glyphs should attach. Thus one could put an anchor centered above
  a lowercase-a indicating that all accents (acute, grave, umlaut, circumflex,
  tilde, macron, ring, caron, ...) should attach there, and underneath all
  the accents one could put another anchor so that when the two glyphs are
  adjacent in the text the word-processor will know where to place the accent
  so that it rides above the "a".
  <TABLE>
    <TR>
      <TD><IMG SRC="a_with_anchor.png" WIDTH=104 HEIGHT=208></TD>
      <TD>+</TD>
      <TD><IMG SRC="grave_with_anchor.png" WIDTH=66 HEIGHT=208></TD>
      <TD>=&gt;</TD>
      <TD><IMG SRC="agrave_anchored.png" WIDTH=104 HEIGHT=208></TD>
    </TR>
  </TABLE>
  <P>
  Not all accents ride centered above the letter (the dot and ogonek ride below
  the letter), so you may need more than one anchor for different styles of
  attachment.
  <P>
  Finally some letters can have multiple attachments, unicode U+1EA4, for example,
  is an A with a circumflex and an acute. Normally the circumflex and the acute
  will attach at the same point, which would be ugly and confusing. Instead
  we create a different kind of anchor, a mark to mark anchor, on the circumflex
  and allow the acute accent to attach to that.
  <P>
  Before one can create an anchor in a glyph one must (of course) create a
  lookup and subtable. This is another Glyph Positioning lookup (so you enter
  it in the GPOS pane). Once you have created the subtable you will be presented
  with another dialog asking for anchor classes, you must create an
  <A HREF="overview.html#Anchors">anchor class</A> for each type of attachment
  (thus in the case of A above with two types of attachments (one above and
  one below) you would create two anchor classes.
  <P>
  Then for each glyph in which an attachment will be made, you should first
  click at the point where the anchor is to be created and then bring up the
  <CODE><A HREF="pointmenu.html#AddAnchor">Point-&gt;Add Anchor</A></CODE>
  dialog.
  <P>
  You can examine (and correct) how a glyph fits to any others that combine
  with it by using the
  <CODE><A HREF="viewmenu.html#AnchorControl">View-&gt;Anchor
  Control...</A></CODE> command.
  <P>
  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>A warning about mark attachments:</STRONG></FONT>
  Not all software supports them. And even more confusing software may support
  them for some scripts and not for others.
