    Advanced Typography Tables
  </H1>
  <P>
  These differ between OpenType (originally called TrueType Open) and Apple
  (GX or Apple Advanced Typography). My support for both OpenType and Apple
  is incomplete.

    <B><CODE>GDEF</CODE></B> and <CODE>BASE</CODE>
    <A NAME="opentype">opentype</A> tables
  </H2>
  <P>
  The first two tables are used for positioning and substituting glyphs. The
  GPOS table can control things like: kerning, accent positioning, cursive
  joining, etc. The GSUB table can control things like: ligatures, arabic forms,
  vertical rotation, conversion to small caps, indic glyph rearrangement, etc.
  GDEF contains some rather esoteric glyph information, ligature carets, etc.
  BASE contains information on baseline placement and line heights.
  <P>
  This page assumes basic familiarity with the abilities of the tables, for
  more information on them read, study and inwardly digest the opentype docs

  <P>
  The basic idea of the GPOS and GSUB tables is that each script (or language
  within a script) has a set of "features" that are available to it. A feature
  in turn is associated with a lookup which contains data for the feature.
  An example of a script is 'latn' for latin, 'arab' for arabic, 'hani' for
  chinese ideographs. Two examples of features are 'kern' which provides kerning
  information between pairs of glyphs and 'init' which will transform one set
  of glyphs to another when those glyphs are at the beginning of a word.
  <P>
  FontForge <A HREF="gposgsub.html#Unsupported">does not support </A>the full
  range of possibilities inherent in these tables.
  <H3>
    The <B><CODE><A NAME="GPOS">GPOS</A></CODE></B> table
  </H3>
  <P>
  FontForge will read the following sub tables of the GPOS table:
  <TABLE Border=1>
    <TR>
      <TH></TH>
      <TH>name</TH>
      <TH>Reading support</TH>
      <TH>Writing support</TH>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>1</TD>
      <TD>single adjustment</TD>
      <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to change the metrics of a specific
	glyph. The feature tag will provide a context in which the change should
	occur. For instance the 'tnum' (tabular numbers) feature could change a
	proportionally spaced digit by adjusting its advance width to be some set
	value and then centering the digit (by adjusting the left side bearing) within
	the new width.</TD>
      <TD>These can be created with the <A HREF="charinfo.html">Element-&gt;Char
	Info</A>-&gt;Position command.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>2</TD>
      <TD>pair adjustment</TD>
      <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to change the metrics of a specific
	pair of glyph. The most common use of this is for kerning where the advance
	width of the first glyph is altered depending on which glyph follows it.
	But the table is more general than that and could support mark (accent, vowel)
	positioning over a base glyph (though that is more efficiently done with
	the mark to base subtable).</TD>
      <TD>'kern' feature s may be created from the <A HREF="metricsview.html">Metrics
	View</A>. 'vkrn' with
	<A HREF="metricsmenu.html#VKernFromHKern">Metrics-&gt;VKern From HKern</A>.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>3</TD>
      <TD>cursive attachment</TD>
      <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to force adjacent glyphs to join
	at specific points. It can be used to generate the slanted script style needed
	for Urdu.</TD>
      <TD>Only the 'curs' feature is supported for this sub-table. These may be
	created with the <A HREF="pointmenu.html#AddAnchor">Points-&gt;Add Anchor</A>
	command</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>4</TD>
      <TD>mark to base</TD>
      <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to specify how mark glyphs (accents,
	vowel signs, etc.) are positioned over base glyphs. Every glyph can have
	an attachment point and the mark's attachment point will be placed on the
	base's attachment point so the two join properly. See my
	<A HREF="overview.html#Anchors">example</A> in the overview.</TD>
      <TD>These may be created with the
	<A HREF="pointmenu.html#AddAnchor">Points-&gt;Add Anchor</A> command</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>5</TD>
      <TD>mark to ligature</TD>
      <TD>This sub-table is very similar to the previous one except that the base
	glyph is a ligature and may have several different points at which the same
	type of accent may be placed.</TD>
      <TD>These may be created with the
	<A HREF="pointmenu.html#AddAnchor">Points-&gt;Add Anchor</A> command</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>6</TD>
      <TD>mark to mark</TD>
      <TD>This sub-table is very similar to the previous two except that the base
	glyph is itself a mark. This may be used when a glyph has two accents each
	of which would normally be placed at the same attachment point on a base
	glyph. The second accent will be place relative to the first accent rather
	than to the base glyph.</TD>
      <TD>These may be created with the
	<A HREF="pointmenu.html#AddAnchor">Points-&gt;Add Anchor</A> command</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>7</TD>
      <TD>contextual positioning</TD>
      <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to control the positioning of
	glyphs when they occur within a specific string (or class of strings). For
	instance this table could say "when you see a digit followed by the string
	"th" then raise the "th" into a superscript position"</TD>
      <TD>These may be created with the
	<A HREF="lookups.html#contextual-subs">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Contextual

    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>8</TD>
      <TD>chaining contextual positioning</TD>
      <TD>This is a slightly more complex version of the above, it doesn't really
	add new capabilities, but it does provide a more logical approach to the
	issue.</TD>
      <TD>These may be created with the
	<A HREF="lookups.html#contextual-subs">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Contextual

    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>9</TD>
      <TD>extension positioning</TD>
      <TD>This is used to allow for a GPOS table which is bigger than 64k. Its
	use should be quite invisible to the font designer</TD>
      <TD>FontForge uses this sub-table when needed.</TD>
    </TR>

      <TD></TD>
      <TD>FontForge does not support these sub-tables yet.<BR>
	(nor does anyone)</TD>
    </TR>
  </TABLE>
  <P>
  FontForge also has built into it knowledge on how to provide default values
  for some features that use these tables. See
  <A HREF="elementmenu.html#DefaultATT">Element-&gt;Typo. Features-&gt;Default
  ATT</A> command for that.
  <P>
  FontForge will retain the order of features in the GPOS table and when a
  font is generated the order should be the same as it was before.
  <H3>
    The <B><CODE><A NAME="GSUB">GSUB</A></CODE></B> table
  </H3>
  <P>
  FontForge will read the following sub tables of the GSUB table:
  <TABLE Border=1>
    <TR>
      <TH></TH>
      <TH>name</TH>
      <TH>Reading support</TH>
      <TH>Writing support</TH>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>1</TD>
      <TD>single substitution</TD>
      <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to change from one glyph to another,
	with a context provided by the feature tag. For example many scripts have
	letters which have a different form at the end of a word than they do within
	(this is true of every letter in arabic, several in hebrew, lower case sigma
	in greek, and the long-s/short-s pair in renaissance latin). So the 'fina'
	feature would map the normal form into the final form, and the word processing
	program would do a lookup at the end of each word to see if a transformation
	was needed.</TD>
      <TD>These can be created with the <A HREF="charinfo.html">Element-&gt;Char
	Info</A>-&gt;Substitution command.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>2</TD>
      <TD>multiple substitution</TD>
      <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to replace one glyph by a series
	of others. This is generally used for rather technical layout issues.</TD>
      <TD>These can be created with the <A HREF="charinfo.html">Element-&gt;Char
	Info</A>-&gt;Multiple Substitution command.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>3</TD>
      <TD>alternate substitution</TD>
      <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to have a series of "alternates"
	for each glyph. One common example would be an italic font which had several
	swash variants for each capital letter. The word processing program would
	allow the user to choose which variant was appropriate</TD>
      <TD>These can be created with the <A HREF="charinfo.html">Element-&gt;Char
	Info</A>-&gt;Alternate Substitution command.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>4</TD>
      <TD>ligature substitution</TD>
      <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to replace a string of glyphs
	with another glyph. A common example is a ligature where the string
	<IMG SRC="f+i.png" WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="Middle"> is replaced by
	the <IMG SRC="fi.png" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="Middle"> ligature.</TD>
      <TD>These can be created with the <A HREF="charinfo.html">Element-&gt;Char

    <TR>
      <TD>8</TD>
      <TD>reverse chaining contextual single substitution</TD>
      <TD>This allows glyph substitutions to happen in reverse order, and it a

  <P>
  FontForge also has built into it knowledge on how to provide default values
  for some features that use these tables. See the [Populate] button of the
  various <A HREF="lookups.html">lookup subtable </A>dialogs.
  <P>
  FontForge can produce some of these tables, but the text layout/word processing
  program used has to look up the tables and do the actual work of rearranging
  the glyphs.
  <P>
  FontForge will retain the order of features in the GSUB table, and the user
  may adjust it with the <A HREF="lookups.html#Order">Element-&gt;Font Info</A>
  command.
  <H3>
    The <B><CODE><A NAME="GDEF">GDEF</A> </CODE></B>table
  </H3>
  <P>
  FontForge will read ligature carets out of a GDEF table.
  <P>
  It will generate a GDEF table containing a glyph class definition sub-table
  (if needed) or a ligature caret sub-table (if needed).

  OpenType uses a four character feature tag (like 'liga') while Apple uses
  two numbers to represent a feature setting (&lt;1,2&gt;). For FontForge to
  be able to inter-convert an OpenType feature into an Apple feature there
  must first be a correspondence between the two naming conventions. Sometimes
  there is an easy direct conversion (above 'liga' and &lt;1,2&gt; both represent
  "Common Ligatures") but far more often there is none. See
  <A HREF="gposgsub.html#OT-Mac-features">below</A> for a list of the tags
  and feature settings that FontForge considers similar enough to interconvert.

    Why do contextual glyph substitutions only <A NAME="sometimes">sometimes</A>
    get generated in AAT?
  </H4>
  <P>
  Sadly OpenType and AAT provide disjoint capabilities when it comes to contextual
  matching. AAT is more capable in some areas, OpenType more capable in others.
  FontForge is able to convert an OpenType contextual substitution into an
  AAT one if FontForge can detect that the OpenType substitution does not use
  capabilities beyond those of AAT. Currently this means:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      There is an apple feature which matches the otf tag
    <LI>
      And one of the following is true:
      <OL>
	<LI>
	  Either
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      The sub-table is in coverage format
	    <LI>
	      The sub-table contains either exactly one nested single glyph replacement
	      substitution, or<BR>
	      it contains exactly two single glyph replacements and one of them refers
	      to the last glyph matched (and the other does not)
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  or
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      The sub-table is in either glyph or class format
	    <LI>
	      If in class format then either the backtrack and lookahead classes must be
	      the same as the main class, or they must not be used.
	    <LI>
	      If a rule has a substitution at a given glyph position, then all rules which
	      match the current rule up to that glyph position must also have a substitution
	      at that position.
	    <LI>
	      A rule with exactly one substitution is acceptable<BR>
	      A rule with one substitution in the middle and one substitution on the last
	      glyph is acceptable.<BR>
	      A rule may contain more substitutions only if there is another rule which
	      matches it exactly up to the internal substitution.<BR>
	      So the following rule set is valid:
	      <TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">

	      </TABLE>
	      <P>
	      So the third rule will match an "ab" and convert them to "AB" (and this is
	      valid because we have one internal and one final substitution and that's
	      ok), then if that "ab" is followed by "cd" then rule 2 kicks in and will
	      replace the "cd" with "CD" (again this has one internal and one final
	      substitution, which is ok), and if that is followed by "ef" then they will
	      be converted to "EF".

	      The two rules have substitutions at different places and that can't be expressed

	  </UL>
      </OL>
  </UL>
  <P>
  FontForge does not even try to convert an AAT contextual glyph substitution
  sub-table, too few of these can be expressed in OpenType to make it worth
  while.
  <P>
  NOTE: It would be possible to convert more lookups to state machines if FontForge
  were willing to:
  <OL>
    <LI>
      Use several state machines to represent complicated lookups
    <LI>
      Add additional glyphs to the font to be used as temporary state flags.
  </OL>
  <P>
  FontForge will do neither of these.
  <H4>
    <FONT COLOR="Red">BUG</FONT>
  </H4>
  <P>
  There is a subtle bug involved in converting a chaining contextual substitution
  into an Apple contextual glyph substitution. AAT does not have the concept
  of a backtrack list, this means that substitutions may occur in a different
  order.
  <H4>
    Why can't all contextual/chaining tables be
    <A NAME="not-converted">converted</A>?
  </H4>
  <P>
  Well, obviously there are some thing that just aren't present. The concept
  of contextual positioning is missing from AAT, while Indic rearrangement
  is missing from OpenType. So let's concentrate on contextual substitutions,
  which both appear to support. The argument that follows is based on the
  capabilities of contextual matching, it applies equally to contextual ligatures,
  glyph insertion, glyph substitution and kerning, the examples given are only
  of glyph substitution because it is easier to represent (and because FontForge
  is only willing to convert contextual glyph substitutions) But even here,
  there is a very basic mismatch in concepts between the way OpenType and Apple
  specify contextual substitutions. Consider the following contextual substitution
  in a glyph list format:
  <TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
    <TR>
      <TH>Initial Sequence</TH>
      <TD>a</TD>
      <TD>b</TD>
      <TD>c</TD>
      <TD>d</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>

      <TD>&nbsp;</TD>
      <TD>B</TD>
      <TD>C</TD>
      <TD>&nbsp;</TD>
    </TR>
  </TABLE>
  <P>
  Now in OpenType this means if you find the sequence "abcd" then replace the
  "b" with "B" and the "c" with "C". But this can't be expressed in an Apple
  state machine. In OpenType the match is done first, and then the substitutions
  occur. In a state machine the substitutions have to be done (almost) concurrently
  with the match and so must happen whether the final "d" is present or not.
  (Note I'm using a glyph sequence because it is easier to display in an example.
  The same problem applies if the substitution is expressed by classes or by
  coverage tables)
  <P>
  Consider the following table with two glyph strings
  <TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
    <TR>
      <TH>Initial Sequence</TH>

  So replace the "b" if the final "d" is present, otherwise replace the "c".
  Again this cannot be expressed in Apple's state machines.

  </TABLE>
  <P>
  If this substitution is given the sequence "abce" it cannot work in AAT.
  When it reads the "a" it will start down the "abcd" branch, the match will
  not fail until it looks for the "d" and finds "e" instead. At that point
  it is too late to switch to the "bce" substitution (which does match) because
  the "b" glyph will not have been marked as a substitution location.
  <P>
    <HR>
  On the other hand, Apple's state machines can express things that OpenType
  tables cannot (again I'm restricting myself to contextual glyph substitutions).
  Consider the case of a swash glyph at the beginning (or end) of a word. Let
  us say that a word begins when a letter appears at the start of input or
  following a whitespace character. But OpenType has no way of expressing "start
  of input" (or end of input) in a contextual/chaining context, whereas Apple's
  state machines do.
  <P>
  Since Apple's glyph substitutions can delete glyphs a contextual glyph
  substitution table can create two character ligatures (one glyph is converted
  to the ligature and the other is deleted), while OpenType tables must use
  a ligature substitution to do this.
  <P>
  Finally an AAT state machine can match a general regular expression, while
  OpenType tables can only match fixed length strings. Suppose you were typesetting
  mathematics and wanted a substitution which would convert an arbitrary digit
  string following a variable into a subscript (so x23 should become
  x<SMALL><SUB>23</SUB></SMALL>). It is easy to write a state machine which
  will keep substituting as long as it gets more digits, but you'd need an
  infinite number of OpenType rules to have the same expressive power.
  <P>
  These examples probably seem fairly contrived, and (except for the swash
  one) they are. But they illustrate the point that the two formats have very
  different expressive capabilities and it is NOT possible to write a converter
  which will take any input in one format and produce an equivalent output
  in the other.

  <P>
  FontForge will retain the order of features in the morx table, and the user
  may adjust it with the <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Lookups">Element-&gt;Font
  Info</A> command. (this is the same list as that used for GSUB table. GSUB
  features that don't correspond to mac features will be ignored).

      FontForge will never generate a 'mort' table. It can read 'mort' tables,
      but it will only produce 'morx' tables.
    <LI>
      FontForge is unable to parse contextual ligatures. It can find ligatures
      which start from state 0, but it will not find ligatures which start from
      other states (that is, which are contextual)
