  Wacom graphics tablets and FontForge
</H1>
<P>
I have added support to FontForge for the wacom graphics tablet. Eventually
I will write some drawing tools that depend on pressure (and tilt perhaps).
<P>
To install a wacom tablet on your (linux) machine you must do two things:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Install a kernel module "wacom.o" into your system<BR>
    Unfortunately the module which ships with linux (Nov 2002) does not work
    but John Joganic has <A HREF="http://linuxwacom.sf.net/">an excellent
    website</A> that will help you install a working driver.
  <LI>
    Install an X11 driver "wacom_drv.o"<BR>
    Again the X11 driver that ships with X does not work for USB tablets. Again
    John's website provides a patched driver.
</UL>
<P>
If you can't get the X11 driver to work, I have hacked a little mini-driver
into FontForge (this can take the place of the X11 driver, it depends on
the kernel driver working). Since the configure script can't detect that
you have a non-working X11 driver on your machine (or a tablet) you must
configure this option by hand. So after the normal configure script has run
(and before typing make):

<P>
Add <CODE>gdrawwacomdriver.lo</CODE> to the list of
<CODE>libgdraw_OBJECTS</CODE> And add <CODE>-D_WACOM_DRV_BROKEN</CODE> to
<CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>.
