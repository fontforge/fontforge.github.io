    Get Info
  </H1>
  <P>
  In the Outline View the Get Info command can generate one of four different
  dialogs depending on what is selected. If a single thing is selected, and
  that thing is a point then the <A HREF="getinfo.html#Point">point info
  </A>dialog is brought up, if it is a reference then the
  <A HREF="getinfo.html#GetReferenceInfo">reference dialog</A> is brought up,
  if it is a background image then the <A HREF="getinfo.html#Image">image
  dialog</A> is brought up. If it is an anchor point then the
  <A HREF="getinfo.html#Anchors">anchor point </A>dialog is brought up.
  <H2>
    <A NAME="Point">Point</A> Info
  </H2>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="pointinfo.png" WIDTH="321" HEIGHT="578" ALIGN="Right"> This shows
  information about the current point. The Base position is where the point
  itself is.
  <P>
  The Next CP shows both the location of the next control point, and the offset
  to that point from the base (and whether this setting is the default for
  that point, if this point is the last on an open contour then the [] Default
  button will be grey), underneath the offsets it shows the same information
  in a different format -- as a distance from the point itself, and the angle
  to it.
  <P>
  The Prev CP does the same for the previous control point.
  <P>
  You may change any of these and the change is reflected in the outline view.
  Your changes are constrained by the point type (for instance with tangent
  points, you may not change the angle fields as these are fixed).
  <P>
  FontForge also shows you the curvature of the two splines on either side
  of the point. In a perfect world these will be equal for curve points and
  the join will appear smooth. It also shows the difference between the two.
  The curvature is the reciprical of the radius of the circle tangent to the
  curve (a straight line has curvature 0 because it is a circle with infinite
  radius so its reciprical is 0). For most curves in letters this radius is
  fairly large when expressed in em-units (and its reciprical is correspondingly
  small). To make it easier to read, FontForge scales it by the em-size of
  the font -- this is equivalent to expressing it in units where 1 corresponds
  to an em (rather than 1000 or 2048).
  <P>
  You may also change whether a point is a curve, corner or tangent point (Caution:
  Changing from a corner point to a curve point and back to a corner point
  is NOT a no op. It may change the control points) You may move on to the
  next or previous point on the path, or the next/previous point of the current
  contour. If you cancel then all changes to all points are canceled.
  <P>
  The colors of the labels reflect the colors of the items they refer to. The
  point itself will be drawn in red, the previous control point will be drawn
  in magenta and the next control point will be drawn in dull cyan.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="pointinfo-interp.png" WIDTH="321" HEIGHT="405" ALIGN="Right">When
  editing truetype interpolated points it is more important to view the control
  points and let the base point continue to be interpolated. The &lt;&gt; Normal
  and &lt;&gt;Interpolated radio buttons control which view is active.
  <P>
  Pressing &lt;&gt; Interpolated may move the point to position it correctly
  for interpolation.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <H3>
    <IMG SRC="hintmaskinfo.png" WIDTH="321" HEIGHT="459" ALIGN="Right"><A NAME="HintMask">Hint</A>
    Mask
  </H3>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="charwithhintmask.png" WIDTH="309" HEIGHT="322" ALIGN="Left">If
  you want to control what hints are active at a given point (and at all subsequent
  points until an new hintmask is given) you can use the hint mask pane. This
  provides you with a list of all hints in the current glyph, you should select
  the ones which you want active.
  <P>
  As you select hints, the glyph view will darken those hints so you can see
  what you've selected.
  <P>
  Points with circles drawn around them have hintmasks.
  <P>
  According to Adobe's documentation you should never have two hints which
  conflict active at the same time. FontForge will warn you if you do this.
  Unfortunately there are fonts (even fonts from Adobe) which do not follow
  this rule, so I have made this a warning rather than an error.
  <P>
  Remember to hold the control key down when making disjoint selections.
  <P>
  Sadly the direction in which hintmasks apply is backwards from what you would
  expect (the hintmask applies to this point an all previous points on the
  contour, rather than all subsequent ones).
  <H4>
    Active Hints
  </H4>
  <P>
  This looks just like the hint mask, except you cannot change anything it
  in. It shows you what hints are currently selected at this point. If a point
  has a hint mask then the two will be identical.
  <P>
  <H2>
    <IMG SRC="spiropointinfo.png" ALIGN="Right" WIDTH="325" HEIGHT="228"><A NAME="Spiro">Spiro</A>
    Point Info
  </H2>
  <P>
  If you are editing in spiro (clothoid) mode rather than Bezier mode, then
  there are no control points and the get info dialog is much simpler. Just
  the location of the point and the point type.
  <P>
  <BR Clear=All>
  <H2>
    <IMG SRC="agetinfo.png" WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="389" ALIGN="Right"><A NAME="Anchors">Anchor
    Points</A> Info
  </H2>
  <P>
  This dialog shows the selected <A HREF="overview.html#Anchors">anchor point</A>
  with the anchor class, location, type and (for ligatures) the ligature index.
  You may change any of these attributes (as long as your changes are reasonable).
  You may create new points or delete the current one. As with normal points
  above you may step through all the anchor points in your glyph.
  <P>
  In a truetype font you can force the anchor to track a contour point in the
  truetype glyph. This point can then be manipulated with truetype instructions
  to grid fit it properly with the current rasterization.
  <P>
  Anchor points may also be created with the
  <A HREF="pointmenu.html#AddAnchor">Point-&gt;Add Anchor</A> command.

  <H2>
    <IMG SRC="rgetinfo.png" WIDTH="319" HEIGHT="480" ALIGN="Right"><A NAME="GetReferenceInfo">Reference</A>
    Info
  </H2>
  <P>
  This dialog shows the name of the selected reference, its encoding in the
  font and its postscript transformation matrix. You may alter the transformation
  matrix if you desire.
  <P>
  The transformation matrix maps points in the glyph being refered to into
  their location in the current glyph: <BR>
  <CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; x<SUB>current</SUB> = TM[1,1]*x<SUB>ref</SUB> +
  TM[2,1]*y<SUB>ref</SUB> + TM[3,1]<BR>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; y<SUB>current</SUB> = TM[1,2]*y<SUB>ref</SUB> +
  TM[2,2]*y<SUB>ref</SUB> + TM[3,2]</CODE>
  <P>
  The Use My Metrics checkbox is useful in truetype fonts where it forces the
  metrics (width) of a composite glyph (for exampe acute a) is the same as
  the metrics of one of its components (for example a). This is especially
  important in fonts containing instructions that might modify a glyph's width.
  <P>
  The Round To Grid checkbox is also used in truetype hints and indicates that
  the translation should be rounded to the rasterizer's grid before being applied
  to the points of the reference. This means that the grid-fitting done by
  the reference's instructions will still be useful in the composite.
  <P>
  In a truetype font a reference may be positioned by matching two points,
  one in the base character, and one in the reference itself. In the example
  at right, the reference to "acute" will be moved until point 12 in "acute"
  is at the same place as point 33 in the base glyph. The glory of this method
  is that the truetype instructions assocated with the glyphs can move these
  points around to an appropriate location for the current pixelsize.
  <P>
  Points in a composite glyph are numbered by counting the points of the first
  component, adding 4 (for the 4 phantom (metric) points), then counting the
  points in the second composite, adding 4, etc. The first composite is the
  one which is drawn first, not the one which is added first. The Base numbering
  scheme is from the full composite, while the reference point is numbered
  by the current reference. The current reference must be drawn after the base
  point. You may use <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Order">Element-&gt;Order</A>
  to reorder the references.
  <P>
  (You should probably not set Round To Grid when doing point matching)
  <P>
  The bounding box information is informative only and displays the current
  location and size of the reference.
  <P>
  The [Show] button will open a glyph outline view showing the glyph being
  referred to.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <H2>
    <A NAME="Image">Image</A> Info
  </H2>
  <P>
  This dialog gives the offset to the lower left corner of the image and the
  scale factors applied to the image. Currently you may not alter anything
  here, it is purely informational.
