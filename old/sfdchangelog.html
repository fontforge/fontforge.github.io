  </H1>
  <P>
  FontForge's <A HREF="sfdformat.html">sfd (spline font database) format</A>
  changes over time as fontforge supports more things. I have only recently
  started keeping track of these changes, so older changes are not listed here.

	  Hmm. Document how vertical kerning subtables are indicated

      5-Mar-2009
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Add support for the JSTF table in sfd.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      12-Nov-2008
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Add a field to the font: ExtremaBound. Any spline where the distance between
	  its end points is less than or equal to this will not be checked for extrema.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      22-Aug-2008
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Add a flag to the Layer keyword (in the font) to say whether the layer is
	  a background layer or not. As the flag is at the end of the line, previous
	  versions of fontforge will just ignore it
      </UL>
    <LI>
      10-July-2008
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Extend the image output format to support red/green/blue/alpha images. (not
	  much of an extension -- there's just more data)
      </UL>
    <LI>
      26-May-2008
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Adobe says UniqueID and XUID are deprecated. Add flags (UseXUID/UseUniqueID)
	  to indicate we still want to include them in fonts in spite of that.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      30-Mar-2008
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Bump the sfd version number to 3. This is a bit late, but better late than
	  never. It should have happened with the Layers release on 2-Mar.
	<LI>
	  Support for BASE table, new keywords
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      BaseHoriz
	    <LI>
	      BaseVert
	    <LI>
	      BaseScript
	  </UL>
	  <P>
	  This also involved removing the old vertical origin keyword which is (I hope)
	  a subset of the BASEline information.
	<LI>
	  Support for Gradient and Pattern Fills in Type3 fonts, new keywords
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      FillGradient

	  <B><BIG>Layers</BIG></B><BR>
	  <FONT COLOR="RED">This turned out to be a change which was backwards
	  incompatible. I did not realize that at the time</FONT>
	  <P>
	  All fonts may now have multiple layers (before only Type3 fonts could). The
	  Type3 format has not changed so the discussion that follows concentrates
	  on normal fonts and should be understood not to refer to type3 fonts.
	  <P>
	  All glyphs in a given (non-type3) font have the same number of layers so
	  there is a LayerCount keyword in the font which provides that (there is also
	  a LayerCount keyword now in each glyph. This provides redundant information,
	  it should be the same as the font's layer count (for non type3 fonts).
	  <P>
	  Before this the foreground and background and Guide layers all had the same
	  spline type (quadratic or cubic), now that can vary from layer to layer.
	  There is a font level keyword "Layer" which provides the spline order and
	  name of each layer. The old "Order2" keyword has been removed.
	  <P>
	  Previously only the foreground layer of a glyph could contain references,
	  now any layer can. Before the "Refer" keyword could appear with no layer
	  name preceding it (as this unambiguously meant that the references would
	  go into the foreground layer), now there must be a layer name preceding a
	  "Refer" keyword.
	  <P>
	  Each layer output is preceded by one of "Fore", "Back" or "Layer: d" (where
	  "d" is the layer number).
	  <P>
	  Before the SplineSet keyword was not needed (and was usually omitted) after
	  a "Fore" or "Back" layer name. It is now required, and this seems to render
	  new sfd files incompatible with old.
	  <P>
	  (If there is no layer tag before a Refer keyword then the parser will apply
	  it to the foreground layer)
	  <P>
	  Previously the validation status applied only to the foreground layer. Now
	  every layer can have its own status, so again the "Validated" keyword must
	  now be tagged with a layer.
	  <P>
	  There is a font level keyword "DisplayFont" which indicates what layer should
	  be displayed in the font view by default.
	  <P>
	  There is a font level keyword "GridOrder2" which may appear before the "Grid"
	  layer name in the font to set the spline order of the guideline semi-layer.
      </UL>

      <UL>
	<LI>
	  The point flags bitmap in a SplineSet has been extended by<BR>
	  0x200 -- Any extrema on the preceding spline are marked as acceptable to
	  the validator
	<LI>
	  Some sfnt tables are now output in text instead of binary.

	      cvt,maxp -- output as decimal numbers (with possibly with comments for cvt)
