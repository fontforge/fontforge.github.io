    The Mac State Machine Dialog
  </H1>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="statemachine-context.png" WIDTH="490" HEIGHT="566" ALIGN="Right">The
  mac uses state machines where opentype would use a contextual lookup. The
  example at right (with appropriate substitutions attached to it) will convert
  an initial or medial short-s into a long-s (for doing renaissance printing).
  <P>
  FontForge currently supports 4 types of state machines: contextual glyph
  substitution, indic rearrangement, contextual glyph insertion, and contextual
  kerning. The example at right is of contextual glyph substitution.
  <P>
  An example conditional substitution state machine is provided in the
  <A HREF="editexample6-5.html#Apple">tutorial</A>.
  <P>
  On the mac there are four predefined classes, one meaning the end of input,
  one for all glyphs not specified elsewhere, one for the magic "deleted" glyph
  (Apple does not always delete a glyph when asked to do so, instead it retains
  a special mark in the glyph stream indicating that the glyph should be deleted
  later), and finally a class for the end of a line of text. Any classes after
  this are user defined. In the example at right there are many user defined
  classes representing various groupings of arabic letters. Any other glyphs
  in the font (the digits for example) will automatically be assigned to class
  1 ("{Everything Else}").
  <P>
  The state machine itself is shown as a two dimensional matrix of transitions,
  one transition for every state and class. Classes are shown at the top of
  the matrix, and states down the side. The transition from state 0 when given
  input from class 0 is shown in the upper left corner of the matrix, and so
  on.
  <P>
  When the state machine starts up it will be in one of the first two states.
  It will be in state 0 at the beginning of input, and in state1 when it starts
  at the beginning of a new line.
  <P>
  The <A NAME="transitions">transitions</A> look slightly differently depending
  on the type of state machine:
  <TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
    <TR>
      <TH>Indic</TH>
      <TH>Contextual</TH>
      <TH>Insertion</TH>
      <TH>Kerning</TH>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD><P ALIGN=Center>
	<IMG SRC="transition-indic.png" WIDTH="54" HEIGHT="64"></TD>

      <TD><P ALIGN=Center>
	<IMG SRC="transition-kern.png" WIDTH="54" HEIGHT="64"></TD>
    </TR>
  </TABLE>
  <P>
  The first line of all transitions shows the next state. The next line contains
  a set of flags where "M" =&gt; the current glyph should be marked (the meaning
  of this becomes apparent later), "A" =&gt; processing should advance to the
  next glyph. For indic tables there is a third flag shown, "L" =&gt; the current
  glyph is the last glyph of the indic rearrangement, while for kerning tables
  there is a "P" flag indicating that the current glyph should be pushed onto
  the kerning stack.
  <P>
  The last two lines have varied meanings depending on the type of the state
  machine.
  <UL>
    <LI>
      For Indic transitions the two lines should be appended to get the indic
      rearrangement verb (in the example above that would be "Ax =&gt; xA" meaning
      that the first glyph marked should be moved after the last glyph marked)
    <LI>
      For contextual transitions the two lines specify the lookup names of simple
      substitutions. The first one is applied to the last glyph marked and the
      second one to the current glyph (if a line is blank, no substitution is applied
      to that glyph here).<BR>
      If a transition has both a "marked substitution" and the "mark current glyph"
      flag, I believe the substitution applies to the glyph that was previously
      marked, and not to the current glyph. (Apple doesn't document
      this)<FONT COLOR="Red"><BR>
      <STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>Apple's 'mort' format was not designed to
      allow fonteditors to figure out what a state machine did. FontForge can usually
      make a good guess of what substitutions do which apply to the current glyph,
      but it will often include extraneous glyph substitutions when a substitution
      applies to a marked glyph. These should not be harmful (they should never
      get invoked) but they are annoying ('morx' tables should not have this problem).
    <LI>
      For insertion transitions the lines specify the glyphs that are to be inserted.
      The first line applies to the marked glyph, the second line to current glyph
      (there may not be room enough to show all the inserted glyphs, in which case
      the glyph list is truncated). There are additional flags here that are also
      not shown because of lack of room. They may be viewed by clicking on a
      transition.
    <LI>
      For kerning transitions the first line shows the first (few) kerning values,
      the second line shows either "..." if there are more kerning values, or
      nothing.<BR>
      Note: The number of kerning values
      <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>MUST</STRONG></FONT> match the number of glyphs
      pushed on the kern stack, or your application crashes.

  <P>
  The general idea is that a word processor converts text into a string of
  glyphs, and then the state machine is applied to that string. The state machine
  starts in state 0 or 1, it figures out what class the first glyph belongs
  to, and indexes into the current state by that class. The transition at that
  location provides a new state to move to (which might be the same as the
  current one), it will usually advance to the next glyph (so the new state
  will be indexed by a different glyph) but sometimes you will want to continue
  processing the current glyph in the new state. Also it will perform a set
  of operations which differ depending on the type of state machine.
  <P>
  Many of the state machines have the concept of a "marked" glyph. This is
  important if the desired change for a given glyph depends on what glyphs
  follow it. In that case when we reach an interesting glyph we "mark" it,
  and then, after reading a few more glyphs when we know what to do, we apply
  a transformation to the marked glyph.
  <TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
    <TR>
      <TH>Indic</TH>
      <TH>Contextual</TH>
      <TH>Insertion</TH>
      <TH>Kerning</TH>
    </TR>
    <TR VALIGN="Top">
      <TD><P ALIGN=Left>
	In addition to a "mark"ed glyph, indic transformations also have a the concept
	of a "last" glyph. There are 16 transformations which may be applied the
	the glyphs between the "mark"ed and "last" glyphs. Suppose the glyph stream
	looks like<BR>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; abcdef<BR>
	And "a" was "mark"ed and "d" was "last" then a transition "AxD =&gt; DxA"
	refers to the marked glyph as "A", the last glyph as "D" and everything in
	between as "x", so this would change the glyph stream to<BR>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; dbcaef</TD>
      <TD>This can apply a substitution to the current glyph, a different substitution
	to the marked glyph, and it may mark the current glyph. The substitutions
	are indicated by 4 character tags and should be "Nested" substitutions which
	may be created by the Element-&gt;Char Info dialog.</TD>
      <TD>This can insert a string (up to 31 glyphs) before or after the current
	and the marked glyphs.</TD>
      <TD>Kerning does not have a single "mark"ed glyph, instead it can push up
	to 8 glyphs onto a stack, and at a later point a set of kerning values may
	be applied to those glyphs (so the flag which is usually indicated as "M"
	for mark, is here "P" for push). Once all the glyphs have been pushed, a
	set of kerning values may be applied. One value for each pushed glyph. This
	is a number which indicates how much the glyph in question should be kerned.
	If the glyph stream looks like:<BR>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; F."<BR>
	and you want to kern "." by -300, and """ by 0 em-units, then you would
	enter<BR>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; -300 0<BR>
	as kerning values.</TD>
