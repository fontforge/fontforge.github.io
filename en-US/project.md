title: What is the FontForge Project?
---

FontForge is libre software, which means free as in freedom (like free speech)
and not merely free as in price (like free beer.) Software freedom means that 
each user has an equal amount of power as the developers over what the 
software does: everyone who has a copy has access to the source code, and is 
free to modify the code to change what the program does. 

Additionally, each user has an equal amount of power as the developers over when and how
copies of the work are distributed. Everyone can redistribute copies,
unchanged or with their improvements, with or without a fee.

With cheap internet access everywhere, that freedoms mean that libre 
software is usually available free of charge. 

But more importantly, the ongoing development of the software is done 
in a very public way: A project.

When users make changes to the code to improve their lives, they can keep 
their changes private. But they are invited by the project to contribute their 
work back 'upstream.' The frequent contributors
review the work, and perhaps after some discussion and revision include 
it in the next release for all other users to enjoy and build on further. 
(The Git version control system and the GitHub website make the process 
convenient.)

Doing something in public inevitably invites discussion, critique, and 
even criticism of what you do. Yet making contributions can be very 
rewarding, and we hope you will find the FontForge  project fun to 
contribute to.
