title: Fund New Features
---

FontForge development is limited by the availability of volunteered time and talent. Contributing financially ensures faster development of new features and fixing of issues.

FontForge can accept donations by PayPal, but these are not routed through a 501(c)3 organization and are thus not tax deductible.

The [Libre Font Fund](https://www.tug.org/fonts/librefontfund.html), a mission of the TeX User Group, is able to accept donations for FontForge development in a way that qualifies for charitable deductions in the United States.
