Most of the GNU+Linux distributions have packages for fontforge, but these will often be a quite old. If you want the latest FontForge, these are your options:

### AppImage

AppImage is a binary format that has improved to the point where it is generally usable by all GNU+Linux users.

With each release, we compile an AppImage. The latest is [2020-03-14](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/releases/download/20200314/FontForge-2020-03-14-67687b0-x86_64.AppImage).

We recommend all users use this method to get the latest release if their distribution has not yet provided it. The Ubuntu PPA, and similar distribution-specific build platforms that put the onus on us, are deprecated and not to be used.

### Compiling

#### From GitHub

Check out [Building From Source](../source), as well as [`INSTALL.md`](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/blob/master/INSTALL.md), for more information on using bleeding edge versions of FontForge, which change every time a developer merges a pull request.

#### From distribution-specific build recipe

Some distributions provide a collection of build recipes which can simplify building on them. On Arch Linux this is called a `PKGBUILD` and one way they are distributed is via the Arch User Repository (AUR): it may be simpler to install [`fontforge-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fontforge-git/) via the AUR if you are an Arch user.

The Alpine Linux version of this is an [`APKBUILD`](https://git.alpinelinux.org/aports/tree/testing/fontforge/APKBUILD). Gentoo Linux calls it a "`portage` overlay", see e.g. [here](http://gpo.zugaina.org/media-gfx/fontforge).

## Other Unices

* [FreeBSD](https://www.freshports.org/print/fontforge) has a FontForge port in its ports tree.
* [netbsd](ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/fonts/fontforge/README.html) builds for various architectures (alpha, i386, ppc, sparc, x86\_64) are available.
* [Solaris](http://www.sunfreepacks.com/) packages for x86 by Apostolos Syropoulos
