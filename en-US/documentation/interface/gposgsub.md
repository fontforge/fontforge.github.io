These differ between OpenType (originally called TrueType Open) and
Apple (GX or Apple Advanced Typography). My support for both OpenType
and Apple is incomplete.

The **`GPOS,`** **`GSUB,`** **`GDEF`** and `BASE` opentype tables
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The first two tables are used for positioning and substituting glyphs.
The GPOS table can control things like: kerning, accent positioning,
cursive joining, etc. The GSUB table can control things like: ligatures,
arabic forms, vertical rotation, conversion to small caps, indic glyph
rearrangement, etc. GDEF contains some rather esoteric glyph
information, ligature carets, etc. BASE contains information on baseline
placement and line heights.

This page assumes basic familiarity with the abilities of the tables,
for more information on them read, study and inwardly digest the
opentype docs on:

-   [The header for both GPOS and
    GSUB](http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_table_formats.html)
-   [The GPOS
    table](http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_table_formats2.html),
    for positioning glyphs
-   [The GSUB
    table](http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_table_formats1.html),
    for substituting glyphs
-   [The GDEF
    table](http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_table_formats5.html),
    for classifying glyphs and for providing a ligature caret table
-   [The BASE
    table](http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_base.html),
    for baseline placement

    opentype](http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_tag3.html)

    opentype](http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_tag1.html)

    opentype](http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_tag2.html)
-   [The list of baseline tags supported by
    opentype](http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_tag4.html)

The basic idea of the GPOS and GSUB tables is that each script (or
language within a script) has a set of "features" that are available to
it. A feature in turn is associated with a lookup which contains data
for the feature. An example of a script is 'latn' for latin, 'arab' for
arabic, 'hani' for chinese ideographs. Two examples of features are
'kern' which provides kerning information between pairs of glyphs and
'init' which will transform one set of glyphs to another when those
glyphs are at the beginning of a word.

FontForge [does not support](#Unsupported)the full range of
possibilities inherent in these tables.

### The **`GPOS`** table

FontForge will read the following sub tables of the GPOS table:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        name                              Reading support                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Writing support
  ----- --------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1     single adjustment                 This sub-table allows the font designer to change the metrics of a specific glyph. The feature tag will provide a context in which the change should occur. For instance the 'tnum' (tabular numbers) feature could change a proportionally spaced digit by adjusting its advance width to be some set value and then centering the digit (by adjusting the left side bearing) within the new width.                   These can be created with the [Element-\>Char Info](../charinfo/)-\>Position command.

  2     pair adjustment                   This sub-table allows the font designer to change the metrics of a specific pair of glyph. The most common use of this is for kerning where the advance width of the first glyph is altered depending on which glyph follows it. But the table is more general than that and could support mark (accent, vowel) positioning over a base glyph (though that is more efficiently done with the mark to base subtable).   'kern' feature s may be created from the [Metrics View](../metricsview/). 'vkrn' with [Metrics-\>VKern From HKern](../metricsmenu/#VKernFromHKern).

  3     cursive attachment                This sub-table allows the font designer to force adjacent glyphs to join at specific points. It can be used to generate the slanted script style needed for Urdu.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Only the 'curs' feature is supported for this sub-table. These may be created with the [Points-\>Add Anchor](../pointmenu/#AddAnchor) command

  4     mark to base                      This sub-table allows the font designer to specify how mark glyphs (accents, vowel signs, etc.) are positioned over base glyphs. Every glyph can have an attachment point and the mark's attachment point will be placed on the base's attachment point so the two join properly. See my [example](overview.html#Anchors) in the overview.                                                                             These may be created with the [Points-\>Add Anchor](../pointmenu/#AddAnchor) command

  5     mark to ligature                  This sub-table is very similar to the previous one except that the base glyph is a ligature and may have several different points at which the same type of accent may be placed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      These may be created with the [Points-\>Add Anchor](../pointmenu/#AddAnchor) command

  6     mark to mark                      This sub-table is very similar to the previous two except that the base glyph is itself a mark. This may be used when a glyph has two accents each of which would normally be placed at the same attachment point on a base glyph. The second accent will be place relative to the first accent rather than to the base glyph.                                                                                         These may be created with the [Points-\>Add Anchor](../pointmenu/#AddAnchor) command

  7     contextual positioning            This sub-table allows the font designer to control the positioning of glyphs when they occur within a specific string (or class of strings). For instance this table could say "when you see a digit followed by the string "th" then raise the "th" into a superscript position"                                                                                                                                      These may be created with the [Element-\>Font Info-\>Contextual](../lookups/#contextual-subs)command

  8     chaining contextual positioning   This is a slightly more complex version of the above, it doesn't really add new capabilities, but it does provide a more logical approach to the issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                These may be created with the [Element-\>Font Info-\>Contextual](../lookups/#contextual-subs)command

  9     extension positioning             This is used to allow for a GPOS table which is bigger than 64k. Its use should be quite invisible to the font designer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                FontForge uses this sub-table when needed.

  10+   reserved for future use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  FontForge does not support these sub-tables yet.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  (nor does anyone)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FontForge also has built into it knowledge on how to provide default
values for some features that use these tables. See [Element-\>Typo.
Features-\>Default ATT](../elementmenu/#DefaultATT) command for that.

FontForge will retain the order of features in the GPOS table and when a
font is generated the order should be the same as it was before.

### The **`GSUB`** table

FontForge will read the following sub tables of the GSUB table:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       name                                              Reading support                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Writing support
  ---- ------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1    single substitution                               This sub-table allows the font designer to change from one glyph to another, with a context provided by the feature tag. For example many scripts have letters which have a different form at the end of a word than they do within (this is true of every letter in arabic, several in hebrew, lower case sigma in greek, and the long-s/short-s pair in renaissance latin). So the 'fina' feature would map the normal form into the final form, and the word processing program would do a lookup at the end of each word to see if a transformation was needed.   These can be created with the [Element-\>Char Info](../charinfo/)-\>Substitution command.

  2    multiple substitution                             This sub-table allows the font designer to replace one glyph by a series of others. This is generally used for rather technical layout issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        These can be created with the [Element-\>Char Info](../charinfo/)-\>Multiple Substitution command.

  3    alternate substitution                            This sub-table allows the font designer to have a series of "alternates" for each glyph. One common example would be an italic font which had several swash variants for each capital letter. The word processing program would allow the user to choose which variant was appropriate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                These can be created with the [Element-\>Char Info](../charinfo/)-\>Alternate Substitution command.

  4    ligature substitution                             This sub-table allows the font designer to replace a string of glyphs with another glyph. A common example is a ligature where the string ![](img/f+i.png) is replaced by the ![](img/fi.png) ligature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       These can be created with the [Element-\>Char Info](../charinfo/)-\>Ligature command.

  5    contextual substitution                           This subtable allows for a string of glyphs to replace another string of glyphs (or class of strings of glyphs)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       These may be created with the [Element-\>Font Info-\>Contextual](../lookups/#contextual-subs)command

  6    chaining contextual substitution                  This is a slightly more complex version of the above, it doesn't really add new capabilities, but it does provide a more logical approach to the issue.

  7    extension positioning                             This is used to allow for a GSUB table which is bigger than 64k. Its use should be quite invisible to the font designer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               FontForge uses this sub-table when needed.

  8    reverse chaining contextual single substitution   This allows glyph substitutions to happen in reverse order, and it a variant of the chaining contextual subtable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     These may be created with the [Element-\>Font Info-\>Contextual]../(lookups/#contextual-subs)command

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                (nor does anyone)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FontForge also has built into it knowledge on how to provide default
values for some features that use these tables. See the [Populate]
button of the various [lookup subtable](../lookups/)dialogs.

FontForge can produce some of these tables, but the text layout/word
processing program used has to look up the tables and do the actual work
of rearranging the glyphs.

FontForge will retain the order of features in the GSUB table, and the
user may adjust it with the [Element-\>Font Info](../lookups/#Order)
command.

### The **`GDEF `**table

FontForge will read ligature carets out of a GDEF table.

It will generate a GDEF table containing a glyph class definition
sub-table (if needed) or a ligature caret sub-table (if needed).

FontForge will currently read and produce (if Apple mode is set in font
generation) the following tables:

  `'kern'`   kerning table          FontForge will read horizontal/vertical kerning pairs and classes. FontForge can read contextual kerning information too into a state machine.   FontForge will produce this if the font contains kerning data -- kerning pairs, kerning by classes, and kerning by state machine.
  `'opbd'`   Optical bounds table   FontForge will read optical bounds                                                                                                               FontForge will produce this table if the user has specified right and left bounds as simple positions ('lfbd' and 'rtbd').

  :  Apple tables corresponding vaguely to [GPOS](#GPOS)

FontForge has support for the `'mort'` and `'morx'` tables (Glyph
metamorphosis and extended glyph metamorphosis tables). These correspond
vaguely to the [GSUB](#GSUB) table. Note: Any feature type/setting
combinations which correspond directly to an open type feature will be
converted to the opentype tag when read in. It will be converted back to
a feature/setting when an apple font is generated (use
[File-\>Preferences](../prefs/#Mac) to extend FontForge's mapping from
feature type/setting to opentype tags).

FontForge can read these and stores them as state machines (which can be

If the font contains any state machines they will be output here. If
there are no state machines then the following conversions of opentype
features will be done:

-   FontForge will generate a cursive connection feature using this
    subtable type if the font contains 'init', 'medi', 'fina' or 'isol'
    simple substitutions.
-   In [some cases](#sometimes) FontForge is able to
    convert an OpenType Contextual/Chaining substitution table into an
    Apple contextual glyph substitution table.

2

ligature substitution

FontForge can read the unconditional information from these and stores
them as opentype ligatures (which can be edited with [Font
Info](../lookups/) or [Char Info](../charinfo/#lookups)).

If there are any ligatures with an apple feature/setting (or which have
an opentype tag which can be converted to an apple feature/setting) then
this table will be output.

have an opentype tag which can be converted to an apple feature/setting)
then this table will be output.

### What features can be interconverted between OpenType and AAT?

Some features have almost the same meaning in OpenType and AAT (although
they are expressed quite differently), others are similar enough that
they can sometimes be converted, and others have essentially no common
ground.

OT Table

AAT Table

Description

GDEF

lcar

The ligature caret information in both 'GDEF' and 'lcar' is essentially
identical and FontForge has no trouble reading both and converting from
one to the other.

BASE

bsln

There is slightly different baseline data in the two formats. 'bsln'
does not provide extent information. 'bsln' provides a baseline for
every glyph, while 'BASE' provides a baseline for every script -- one
hopes all glyphs in a script will have the same baseline, but it isn't
guaranteed. Finally 'bsln' and 'BASE' provide a slightly different set
of baseline tags, and FontForge only supports the OpenType ones. In
particular Apple's ideographic centered baseline will be lost.

GPOS

kern

In most cases kerning information can be converted from one format to
another. Both provide support for vertical kerning and right to left
kerning. Both provide support for kerning by glyph pair and kerning by
classes.

OpenType allows kerning commands to be supplied via a contextual
chaining feature, Apple allows them to be controled by a state machine.
FontForge supports both, but does not interconvert.

GPOS

opbd

The GPOS features 'lfbd' and 'rtbd' provide the information needed to
generate an Apple opbd table. If FontForge reads a font with an opbd
table it will generate appropriate 'lfbd' and 'rtbd' features. If
FontForge generates a font in apple mode that has these features it will
create an opbd table. Similarly when FontForge reads an opbd table it
will create 'lfbd' and 'rtbd' features.

GPOS

* * * * *

I am not aware of any way to convert other GPOS features to AAT.

GSUB

morx

The 'mort' and 'morx' tables have the same capabilities ('mort' tables
are an old format and Apple currently encourages that 'morx' tables be
used instead). FontForge can read either one, but only generates 'morx'
tables. Interconversion depends on specific feature types and the
sub-table formats, see below

GSUB

mort

#### An analysis of GSUB and morx sub-tables and feature tags

OpenType uses a four character feature tag (like 'liga') while Apple
uses two numbers to represent a feature setting (\<1,2\>). For FontForge
to be able to inter-convert an OpenType feature into an Apple feature
there must first be a correspondence between the two naming conventions.
Sometimes there is an easy direct conversion (above 'liga' and \<1,2\>
both represent "Common Ligatures") but far more often there is none. See
[below](#OT-Mac-features) for a list of the tags and
feature settings that FontForge considers similar enough to
interconvert.

GSUB tables have 7 sub-table formats, while morx tables have 5.

GSUB
 sub-
 table

morx
 sub-
 table

Description

Single

Non-
 Contextual
 Glyph

These two sub-tables have almost exactly the same capabilities. Each
allows one glyph to be substituted for another. The morx sub-table also
allows a glyph to be deleted, while the GSUB sub-table does not.

Multiple

This GSUB subtable allows a single glyph to be replaced by multiple
glyphs. It has some similarities to Apple's Glyph Insertion sub-table
except:

-   the 'morx' sub-table always leaves the current glyph in the glyph
    stream, while this sub-table need not
-   the 'morx' sub-table is contextual while this sub-table is never.
    (But if this sub-table is wrapped inside a Context or Chaining
    Context subtable the result can be contextual).

Glyph
 Insertion

This morx subtable allows a string of glyphs to be inserted before or
after the current glyph (the current glyph always remains). This
sub-table is contextual (ie. the insertion can be restricted to certain
contexts). It bears some similarities to the GSUB Multiple subtable
above.

Alternate

This GSUB subtable allows a single glyph to be replaced by any one of
several alternatives (presumably with help from a word processor's UI).
An example of this would be a character which had several swash
variants. There is nothing like this in the 'morx' table.

Ligature

Ligature

Both formats have ligature sub-tables. The 'GSUB' version is
unconditional (the ligature is always applied -- though a ligature
substitution could be embedded in an OpenType contextual substitution to
make it condtional). The 'morx' version can be contextual (though in
fonts I have examined it is usually uncontextual). FontForge only
supports unconditional ligatures.

FontForge can read all the unconditional ligatures from a 'morx'
sub-table. FontForge loses all contextual ligatures.

In OpenType, contextual ligatures can be built by wrapping a ligature
sub-table inside a Context or Chaining Context subtable.

Contextual
 Glyph

This morx subtable allows single glyph substitutions to be applied
within certain contexts. At first glance it seems that this could be
converted into an opentype Context subtable, [but this is rarely the
case](#sometimes).

Context

These GSUB subtables allow any collection of other substitutions to be
applied contextually. At first glance one might think that these (with
appropriate nested substitutions) might be converted to 'morx'
contextual glyph substitutions, contextual ligatures, or even glyph
insertion. [Unfortunately this is rarely the
case](#sometimes).

Chaining
 Context

Reverse
 Chaining
 Context

This GSUB subtable is applied backwards to the stream of glyphs, it
allows a single glyph substitution per contextual match. There is
nothing like it in 'morx'.

Indic
 Rearrange-
 ment

This 'morx' subtable allows for several glyphs to interchange their
positions in the glyph stream. There is nothing like it in GSUB (or GPOS
for that matter).

#### Why do contextual glyph substitutions only sometimes get generated in AAT?

Sadly OpenType and AAT provide disjoint capabilities when it comes to
contextual matching. AAT is more capable in some areas, OpenType more
capable in others. FontForge is able to convert an OpenType contextual
substitution into an AAT one if FontForge can detect that the OpenType
substitution does not use capabilities beyond those of AAT. Currently
this means:

-   There is an apple feature which matches the otf tag
-   And one of the following is true:
    1.  Either
        -   The sub-table is in coverage format
        -   The sub-table contains either exactly one nested single
            glyph replacement substitution, or
             it contains exactly two single glyph replacements and one
            of them refers to the last glyph matched (and the other does
            not)

    2.  or
        -   The sub-table is in either glyph or class format
        -   If in class format then either the backtrack and lookahead
            classes must be the same as the main class, or they must not
            be used.
        -   If a rule has a substitution at a given glyph position, then
            all rules which match the current rule up to that glyph
            position must also have a substitution at that position.
        -   A rule with exactly one substitution is acceptable
             A rule with one substitution in the middle and one
            substitution on the last glyph is acceptable.
             A rule may contain more substitutions only if there is
            another rule which matches it exactly up to the internal
            substitution.
             So the following rule set is valid:

            Rule

            a

            b

            c

            d

            e

            f

            Rule

            a

            b

            c

            d

            Rule

            a

            b

            Substitutions

            A

            B

            C

            D

            E

            F

            So the third rule will match an "ab" and convert them to
            "AB" (and this is valid because we have one internal and one
            final substitution and that's ok), then if that "ab" is
            followed by "cd" then rule 2 kicks in and will replace the
            "cd" with "CD" (again this has one internal and one final
            substitution, which is ok), and if that is followed by "ef"
            then they will be converted to "EF".

            The following is not valid:

            Substitution

            B

            Rule

            a

            b

            c

            * * * * *

            Rule

            a

            b

            Substitution

            A

            The two rules have substitutions at different places and
            that can't be expressed in an Apple state machine given that
            they have the same glyphs.

FontForge does not even try to convert an AAT contextual glyph
substitution sub-table, too few of these can be expressed in OpenType to
make it worth while.

NOTE: It would be possible to convert more lookups to state machines if
FontForge were willing to:

1.  Use several state machines to represent complicated lookups
2.  Add additional glyphs to the font to be used as temporary state
    flags.

FontForge will do neither of these.

#### BUG

There is a subtle bug involved in converting a chaining contextual
substitution into an Apple contextual glyph substitution. AAT does not
have the concept of a backtrack list, this means that substitutions may
occur in a different order.

#### Why can't all contextual/chaining tables be converted?

Well, obviously there are some thing that just aren't present. The
concept of contextual positioning is missing from AAT, while Indic
rearrangement is missing from OpenType. So let's concentrate on
contextual substitutions, which both appear to support. The argument
that follows is based on the capabilities of contextual matching, it
applies equally to contextual ligatures, glyph insertion, glyph
substitution and kerning, the examples given are only of glyph
substitution because it is easier to represent (and because FontForge is
only willing to convert contextual glyph substitutions) But even here,
there is a very basic mismatch in concepts between the way OpenType and
Apple specify contextual substitutions. Consider the following
contextual substitution in a glyph list format:

Initial Sequence

a

b

c

d

Replace With

 

B

C

 

Now in OpenType this means if you find the sequence "abcd" then replace
the "b" with "B" and the "c" with "C". But this can't be expressed in an
Apple state machine. In OpenType the match is done first, and then the
substitutions occur. In a state machine the substitutions have to be
done (almost) concurrently with the match and so must happen whether the
final "d" is present or not. (Note I'm using a glyph sequence because it
is easier to display in an example. The same problem applies if the
substitution is expressed by classes or by coverage tables)

Consider the following table with two glyph strings

Initial Sequence

a

b

c

d

Replace With

 

B

 

Initial Sequence

a

b

c

e 

Replace With

 

 C

 

So replace the "b" if the final "d" is present, otherwise replace the
"c". Again this cannot be expressed in Apple's state machines.

Finally consider

Initial Sequence

a

b

c

d

Replace With

 

C

 

Initial Sequence

b

c

e

Replace With

B 

 

 

If this substitution is given the sequence "abce" it cannot work in AAT.
When it reads the "a" it will start down the "abcd" branch, the match
will not fail until it looks for the "d" and finds "e" instead. At that
point it is too late to switch to the "bce" substitution (which does
match) because the "b" glyph will not have been marked as a substitution
location.

On the other hand, Apple's state machines can express things that
OpenType tables cannot (again I'm restricting myself to contextual glyph
substitutions). Consider the case of a swash glyph at the beginning (or
end) of a word. Let us say that a word begins when a letter appears at
the start of input or following a whitespace character. But OpenType has
no way of expressing "start of input" (or end of input) in a
contextual/chaining context, whereas Apple's state machines do.

Since Apple's glyph substitutions can delete glyphs a contextual glyph
substitution table can create two character ligatures (one glyph is
converted to the ligature and the other is deleted), while OpenType
tables must use a ligature substitution to do this.

Finally an AAT state machine can match a general regular expression,
while OpenType tables can only match fixed length strings. Suppose you
were typesetting mathematics and wanted a substitution which would
convert an arbitrary digit string following a variable into a subscript
(so x23 should become x~23~). It is easy to write a state machine which
will keep substituting as long as it gets more digits, but you'd need an
infinite number of OpenType rules to have the same expressive power.

These examples probably seem fairly contrived, and (except for the swash
one) they are. But they illustrate the point that the two formats have
very different expressive capabilities and it is NOT possible to write a
converter which will take any input in one format and produce an
equivalent output in the other.

FontForge will retain the order of features in the morx table, and the
user may adjust it with the [Element-\>Font Info](../fontinfo/#Lookups)
command. (this is the same list as that used for GSUB table. GSUB
features that don't correspond to mac features will be ignored).

What is Unsupported?
--------------------

FontForge does not (yet) support all the advanced typographic features
available in either opentype or apple advanced typography.

### OpenType

-   FontForge does not provide an attachment list subtable nor a
    MarkAttachClassDef subtable of the GDEF table.
-   FontForge does not support the VORG and JUST tables

[See here for a complete list of supported tables](../../reference/TrueOpenTables/).

### Apple Advanced Typography

-   FontForge will never generate a 'mort' table. It can read 'mort'
    tables, but it will only produce 'morx' tables.
-   FontForge is unable to parse contextual ligatures. It can find
    ligatures which start from state 0, but it will not find ligatures
    which start from other states (that is, which are contextual)
-   FontForge does not support the following Apple specific tables
    -   acnt (accent attachment)
    -   bsln (baseline)
    -   fdsc (font descriptor)
    -   fmtx (font metrics)
    -   hsty (horizontal style)
    -   just (justification)
    -   trak (tracking)
    -   Zapf (glyph reference)
