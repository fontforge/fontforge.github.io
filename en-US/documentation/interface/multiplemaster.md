Allows you to create or modify a multiple master font

What is a multiple master font?
-------------------------------

A multiple master font is a ([PostScript
Type1](http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5015.Type1_Supp.pdf))
font which contains, in one font description several extreme styles of a
font family and code for interpolating between them to produce
intermediate designs. Apple has a [similar
concept](http://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6fvar.html)for
TrueType -- The only name I've seen given to this is "Apple Distortable
Font" -- I call both multiple master.

A multiple master font has several axes along which variation may occur.
For example a font might allow variation along the Weight axis
(everything from Thin to Black), along the Width axis (Condensed to
Extended) and along the Optical Size axis (from 6pt to 72pt). The Type1
spec requires that there be a design for every extreme combination along
each axis. In the above example there should be:

-   Thin Condensed 6pt
-   Thin Condensed 72pt
-   Thin Extended 6pt
-   Thin Extended 72pt
-   Black Condensed 6pt
-   Black Condensed 72pt
-   Black Extended 6pt
-   Black Extended 72pt

A font designer may also add intermediate designs as well.

From these extreme designs PostScript is able to interpolate any
intermediate style desired (as Normal Normal 12pt).

Apple has a slightly different format, not only must the extreme designs
be specified but the default designs must be as well (so Apple requires
3 designs per axis as opposed to 2 for PostScript). In the above example
there would be 27 designs:

-   Thin Condensed 6pt
-   Thin Condensed 12pt
-   Thin Condensed 72pt
-   Thin 6pt
-   Thin 12pt
-   Thin 72pt
-   Thin Extended 6pt
-   Thin Extended 12pt
-   Thin Extended 72pt
-   Regular Condensed 6pt
-   ...
-   Black Extended 72pt

Apple also allows for intermediate designs, but FontForge does not
currently support this.

A font designer first determines how many axes s/he will need.
PostScript allows a maximum of 4 axes in a Type1 font. FontForge only
supports 4 axes for Apple's fonts too.

Then s/he provides information about each axis, specifically:

-   The axis type (Weight, Width, Optical Size, etc)
-   The range of design values over which this axis will vary
     Typically 1-999 for Weight and Width (1 being extremely thin or
    condensed, 999 being extremely black or extended) or 6-72 for
    Optical Size
     Apple fonts seem to have a different default range, .05-2.0
-   A mapping from the design value range to the range [0 1] called the
    normalized range. (Apple maps to [-1,1] with the default design
    mapped to 0)
     This mapping is piecewise linear. Generally it will just be the
    obvious (1=\>0.0, 999=\>1.0) but it is possible to add intermediate
    points so that 500=\>.3 which would give a different scaling between
    1&500 than between 500&999.
-   In an apple distortable font, each axis must be given a name which
    may be translated into multiple languages.

Then s/he determines the number of designs needed. In a Type1 font there
may be at most 16, and at least 2\^axis-count. So in a 3 axis font there
must be at least 8 designs, one for each extreme.

For Type1 fonts s/he needs to write two postscript functions

NormalizeDesignVector

FontForge is always able to generate this function for the user (unless
the user wants something non-linear). This maps a vector of design
values to their normalized values (in our three axis case above it might
map [400 500 12] to [.4 .5 .09])

ConvertDesignVector

In the usual cases FontForge is able to create this function for the
user (but in more complicated cases, with intermediate designs it is
unable to do so). This function takes a normalized vector (as produced
above) and figures out how much each weight to give each design in the
final blend.

Finally s/he provides a default vector of design weights (one for each
design). This will be used when the multiple master font is used without
any additional information being provided. It should describe the normal
variant of the font. The sum of all the weights must be 1.0. In the
above example, if we take [400 500 12] as our definition of "normal"
this vector might look like: [.273 .027 .273 .027 .182 .018 .182 .018].

Apple distortable fonts do not need the postscript functions, nor the
default weight vector mentioned above. Instead they need a set of named
styles which map a particular coordinate in design space to a name
(which may be provided in several languages).

Corresponding glyphs in each design must have certain similarities:

-   There must be the same number of contours (or references)
-   There must be the same number of points on each contour
-   Corresponding contours must be oriented in the same direction
-   In a Type1 fonts there must be corresponding hints, and hint
    substitution points.
-   In a TrueType font corresponding glyphs share the same instructions
    (and 'fpgm' and 'prep' tables), but may have different 'cvt '
    tables.

The Dialog
----------

This dialog is used for creating and modifying multiple master fonts. It
contains several sub-dialogs which must be processed in sequence, and
follows pretty closely to the process described above. I will first show
the sequence for Adobe's fonts, and then explain Apple's fonts.

![](img/mmcounts.png)The first screen allows you to choose the type of
distortable font you wish to generate (Adobe Multiple Master, or Apple),
the number of axes in your font, and the number of master designs, and a
family name (which will be used for creating new fonts, if you need any
new ones).

![](img/mmaxes.png)The second screen gives you control of each axis. There
are a few standard axis types defined by Adobe (and by Apple), but you
could define your own. Note that there are fields which are disabled
here, they only apply to Apple's fonts.

![](img/mmdesigns.png)Then you must assign a font to each of the master
designs. You can either have FontForge create a new font for you (as
here), or use an already loaded font, or browse your disk for a font
(don't try to use the same font twice).

You must also specify the coordinates of this design along the axes. If
you use the minimum number of designs they will all be extremes and the
coordinate values will be either 0 or 1. Unless you are working with
intermediate designs it is best to let FontForge initialize this field
for you.

![](img/mmfuncs.png)This screen shows the postscript functions needed to map
a design vector to a weight vector (ie. given positions on each of the
design axes, these produce blending coefficients for each master
design). In most useful case FontForge is able to generate these
functions automatically, but if you use intermediate designs things get
too complicated for FontForge and you must enter the functions
manually.

![](img/mmfinal.png)The last screen shows the default weights (which you may
either enter directly or as coordinates along the design axes), the
ForceBoldThreshold private dictionary entry).

### An Apple distortable font.

![](img/mmappleaxes.png)The dialog looks very similar, but there are a few
differences. In the Axis pane of the dlg, you must also specify a
default value for the axis, and a translatable name.

![](img/mmnamedstyles.png)Apple allows coordinates in design space to be
named. Here the name "Black" is given to the location where Weight=3.2
(the darkest value) and ![](img/mmnamingastyle.png)Width=1 (the default
value). Again these names can be translated into multiple languages.

A suggestion
------------

Adobe's Type1 fonts require all the extreme designs to be specified, so
that for a 3 axis multiple master font, you need 8 designs. This is
because Adobe only seems to expect interpolation to be used. On the
other hand in many cases extrapolation can be used to generate some of
these designs. In the 3 axis case you only need to produces 4 designs
(one for the base, and one each to express the variation on each axis).

I will describe the 2 axis case in detail (because it is easier to
visualize): Suppose you have a font which varies on the Weight axis from
50 to 900, and on the Width axis from 100 to 1000. And suppose you have
created fonts for Weight=50,Width=100 & Weight=50, Width=100 &
Weight=900,Width=100. Call these designs 0, 1 and 2. We wish to produce
a design, 3, with Weight=900, Width=1000.

![](img/mmextrapolate2.png)

First we must produce an intermediate design (which we will delete
later), call it "I". Use FontForge's Element-\>Interpolate Fonts command
to produce a design which is 50% of the way from design 1 to design 2
(This will be Weight=475, Width=550). Then produce another design with
is 200% of the way from design 0 to design "I". This will be the desired
extreme design.

Adobe's Type2 designs appear to have been prepared to allow this
approach, but the multiple master operators were dropped from the Type2
spec, and the question is moot.
