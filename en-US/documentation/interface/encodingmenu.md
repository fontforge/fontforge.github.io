Reencode

Has an attached sub-menu of standard and user defined encodings. The
font's current encoding will be indicated with a check mark. You may
change the encoding by selecting a different entry.

There are two slightly different formats an encoding can take. It can be
defined by unicode code points, or it can be defined by glyph names.
When reencoding to an encoding defined by code points, the glyph with
the matching unicode value is placed in the encoding slot. When
reencoding to an encoding defined by glyph name, we first search for a
glyph with the matching name and use it, if not found we search for the
glyph name's corresponding unicode code point (if any) and if found we
change its name to that specified by the encoding.

Example: Suppose we have a font containing a glyph named "uni0041", and
an encoding which maps U+0041-\>slot 65, then the glyph will be moved
into slot 65. If we have another encoding which maps "A" -\> slot 65,
then (since "A" has unicode value U+0041) our glyph will still be mapped
to slot 65, but in addition its name will be changed to "A".

Compact

Remove any holes from the encoding so all the glyphs get smushed
together. If the font is already compact, then selecting this again will
restore the original.

Force Encoding

Has the same sub-menu as above. Here we assume that the glyphs of the
font are currently encoded in the right order, but they have the wrong
names (This may seem odd, but it happens a lot). This command will
change the names of all the glyphs to match what they should be if the
indicated encoding were in force.

Add Encoding Slots...

Add some extra slots at the end of the font into which you can put
unencoded glyphs (variant glyphs, etc.)

Remove Unused Slots

Removes any unused slots from the end of the font. It does not remove
unused slots inside the font, that would screw up the encoding.

Detach Glyphs

Detaches any selected encoding slots from their currently associated
glyphs. These slots will now be marked as unused. The glyphs will remain
in the font, just not encoded (If you reencode the font those glyphs
will become visible again).

Detach & Remove Glyphs...

Similar to the above except that any glyphs detached (which are not used
elsewhere in the encoding) will be removed from the font.

Add Encoding Name...

Requests an encoding name from the user and searches for it in the
iconv() database. It then adds that encoding to the menu.

Load Encoding...

Asks the user for a filename and attempts to load a user defined
encoding from that file. (You can only load small encodings -- one byte
encodings)

Make from Font...

Allows you to name the font's current encoding (if it isn't already
named), and add it to the encoding menu.

Remove Encoding...

Removes one of the user defined encodings from the menu.

Display by Group...

Allows you restrict the glyphs displayed in the font view to those in a
user defined [group](../groups/) (specified in the next command).

Define Groups...

Allows you to define [groups](../groups/) of glyphs which (presumably)
have some meaningful connection to each other.

Save NameList of Font...

Creates a [namelist](#namelist) file mapping unicode to the glyph names
of the current font.

Load NameList...

Loads a [namelist](#namelist) file into fontforge and copies it so that
fontforge will load it on start up in the future.

Rename Glyphs...

Allows you to specify a [namelist](#namelist). All glyphs in the current
font will be renamed to match the scheme in the namelist.

Create Named Glyphs...

Allows you to specify a file containing a list of glyph names. FontForge
will create a sequence of unencoded glyphs with these names. This might
be useful if all your fonts contain small caps and you always want to
have the names "A.small", "B.small", "C.small" etc. or perhaps you
always want the ligatures "longs\_longs\_t", "f\_longs", "f\_j", etc.

General notes on encodings
--------------------------

Not all font formats support all encodings. SVG fonts will always be
output in a unicode encoding, truetype fonts in either unicode or one of
the CJK encodings, type1 fonts only support single byte encodings, etc.

In a CID keyed font you are not allowed to change the encoding (in
essence because there is none), but there is an entry [CID-\>Change
Supplement](../cidmenu/#ChangeSup)which will display the
Registry/Ordering information and allow you to change the supplement.

### Built in Encodings

FontForge knows about the following encodings by default:

-   ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) -- traditional encoding for western european
    characters. Default encoding for http. Does not include the Euro
    sign.
-   ISO-8859-15 (Latin0) -- Replacement for Latin1. Does include the
    Euro.
-   ISO-8859-2 (Latin2) -- Central & Eastern European (Czech, Hungarian,
    Polish, Romanian, Croatian, Slovak, Slovnian.
-   ISO-8859-3 (Latin3) -- Southern European (Esperanto, Maltese)
-   ISO-8859-4 (Latin4) -- Northern European (Estonian, Latvian,
    Lithuanian, Greenlandic, Lappish)
-   ISO-8859-9 (Latin5) -- Turkish
-   ISO-8859-10 (Latin6) -- Nordic (reworking of Latin4&Latin1)
-   ISO-8859-13 (Latin7) -- Another Baltic character set
-   ISO-8859-14 (Latin8) -- Celtic (Gaelic & Welsh)
-   ISO-8859-5 (Cyrillic)
-   ISO-8859-6 (Arabic)
-   ISO-8859-7 (Greek)
-   ISO-8859-8 (Hebrew) -- (and Yiddish)
-   ISO-8859-11 (Thai) -- Also know as TIS 620
     \<there is no ISO-8859-12\>

    * * * * *

-   KOI8-R -- Cyrillic
-   Macintosh Roman
-   Windows "ANSI" (CodePage1252)
-   Adobe Standard
-   Symbol
-   TeX Base

    * * * * *

-   ISO-10646-1 (Unicode, BMP)
-   ISO-10646-1 (Unicode, Full)
-   ISO-10646-? (Unicode, by plane)
     (You can select a specific plane of unicode as an encoding (ie BMP,
    SMP, SIP,...)

    * * * * *

-   SJIS
-   JIS 208 -- Japanese Kanji (first 8000 characters)
-   JIS 212 -- Japanese Kanji (next 8000 characters)
-   Wansung
-   KSC 5601 -- Korean (this is the 94x94 version of KSC 5601)
-   Johab
-   GB 2312 -- Simplified Chinese
-   Packed GB 2312 -- (I don't know what the proper name for this is,
    ASCII for bytes\<0x80, and GB 2312 EUC offset by 0x8080)
-   Big5 -- Traditional Chinese

    * * * * *

-   Custom -- An unknown encoding
-   Glyph Order -- the glyph ordering used in the original font file.

### User Defined Encodings

You can also add new encodings to the set that FontForge knows about.
There are three menu items that manipulate a set of user defined
encodings. As always these specify both a character set and an encoding.
The encoding has a maximum of 256 entries, but the character set may be
larger (up to 1024). This means that you can define a font with extra
characters. Since postscript fonts can be reencoded at runtime this can
be useful.

The Load Encoding command allows you to load an encoding(s) from a file.
Currently the file must either be in the format used by the unicode
consortium for [mapping ISO
8859](http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/ISO8859/) encodings to
unicode, or it must be a postscript encoding array. The first format
looks like this:

>     0x20   0x0020  #   SPACE
>     0x21    0x0021  #   EXCLAMATION MARK
>     ...

A postscript file looks like:

>     /TeXBase1Encoding [
>      % 00
>      /.notdef /dotaccent /fi /fl
>      /fraction /hungarianumlaut /Lslash /lslash
>      ...
>     ] def

There may be more than one encoding in a postscript file. The encoding
parser is not smart. It will only read arrays specified like this, don't
try any of the innumerable other ways of specifying an array in
postscript.

If the font has a custom encoding then the `Make From Font` menu item is
enabled. This allows you to name the encoding you have defined for the
current font.

The `Remove Encoding` menu item brings up a list showing all the custom
encodings and allows you to delete them.

Here's an [example of a postscript encoding file](Encodings.ps.gz). It
contains:

-   TeXMathItalicEncoding
-   TeXMathSymbolEncoding
-   TeXMathExtensionEncoding

    * * * * *

-   IsoLatin -- (which specifies all the characters used in any of the
    ISO-Latin-\* fonts

    * * * * *

-   AdobeExpert -- (Which contains things like lower case numbers, small
    caps, fractions, sub/superscript numbers, etc.)

    * * * * *

-   CodePage1250 -- Microsoft's encoding for Central European characters
-   CodePage1251 -- Microsoft's Cyrillic encoding
-   CodePage1252 -- Microsoft's Western European encoding (a superset of
    Latin1. Sometimes called "ANSI" though I can find no ANSI standard
    that it follows)
-   CodePage1253 -- Microsoft's Greek encoding
-   CodePage1254 -- Microsoft's Turkish encoding
-   CodePage1255 -- Microsoft's Hebrew encoding (an extension of
    ISO-8859-8)
-   CodePage1256 -- Microsoft's Arabic encoding
-   CodePage1257 -- Microsoft's Baltic encoding
-   CodePage1258 -- Microsoft's Viet Namese encoding
-   CodePage874 -- Microsoft's Thai encoding

    * * * * *

-   MacCentralEuropean
-   MacCyrillic
-   MacGreek
-   MacHebrew

    * * * * *

-   US-ASCII -- Not really useful by itself any more, but provides the
    first 128 characters of almost every other encoding.

NameLists
---------

Adobe has established a standard glyph naming convention which provides
intelligible names for many glyphs of unicode characters. And some
unintelligible names too.

A [namelist](overview.html#Glyph-names) is just a mapping from unicode
to glyph names (a glyph name must be made up of alphanumeric characters
(or the special characters '.' or '\_'), it may not begin with a digit,
and it must be 31 or fewer characters in length.

FontForge provides a series of standard namelists:

-   Adobe Glyph List
     This is the set of names that Adobe publishes on the web.
-   AGL without afii
     The cyrillic and hebrew glyphs have been assigned some very odd
    names (afiiXXXXX) and some people prefer not to use them.
-   AGL with PUA
     Adobe has assigned part of the unicode public use area to hold some
    standard glyph variants like small caps, subscripts, old-style
    numbers, etc.
-   Greek small caps
     I've added some greek small cap assignments
-   TeX Names
     The TeX typesetting system has its own set of names
-   AMS Names
     The American Mathematical Society has its set of names (see the
    American Mathematical Society's
    [specification](http://www.ams.org/STIX/bnb/stix-tbl.asc-2003-10-10))

You may define your own namelist file. It should have the extension
".nam". And it should contain a series of lines that look like:

>     0x0020 space
>     0x0021 exclam
>     0x0022 dblquote

In many cases you will just want to make a few modifications to an
already existing namelist. You can write:

>     Based: Adobe Glyph List
>     0x0021 exclamation

Which means the namelist is the same as the Adobe Glyph List except that
in your system U+0021 will be called "exclamation" rather than "exclam".

Any glyphs you do not explicitly name will be named "uniXXXX" or
"uXXXXX" where XXXX is the unicode value in hex. The prefix "uni" will
be used for glyphs in the BMP, the prefix "u" for glyphs outside.

I said that glyph names should contain only alphanumeric characters (and
some others). But really this is only true of glyph names that get
output into a font. If you design your own namelist you may include
whatever glyph names you like, using (almost) the full range of unicode
-- provided you rename all your glyphs to Adobe's names before you
generate a font. If you use non-ASCII characters you should encode the
file in utf-8.

FontForge normally will restrict glyph names to be within the ASCII
range, but if you go to File-\>Preferences-\>Generic-\>UnicodeGlyphNames
and set it on you can use unicode.

I've created a [french namelist](ListeDesGlyphs.nam) which uses accented
letters. This will work fine within fontforge, and most rasterizers will
parse fonts generated using such names -- but they are non-standard and
may cause problems. Best to do a rename just before generating your
font.

So if you find it easier to work with names other than those Adobe has
established you may create your own namelist file. Then use
[Encoding-\>Load NameList...](#LoadNL) to load that into FontForge (you
only need do this once, FontForge should remember it thereafter). You
may use [File-\>Preferences-\>Font Info](../prefs/#NewFontNameList) to
decree that all your new fonts will use this namelist. You can change a
font's namelist with either:

-   [Element-\>Font
    Info-\>General-\>NameList](../fontinfo/#PS-General)
     Which will change the way new glyphs are assigned names
-   [Encoding-\>Rename Glyphs...](#RenameGlyphs)
     Which will rename existing glyphs as well as changing the way new
    glyphs are named.

You may also want to force a rename of all glyphs when you Open a font,
and the open dialog now lets you do this. Similarly when generating a
font you will probably want to force that font to be use the standard
names of the Adobe Glyph List.
