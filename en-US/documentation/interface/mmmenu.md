title: Multiple Master menu
---

The MM Menu provides a few commands for manipulating [Multiple Master or
Apple distortable fonts](../multiplemaster/#MM). If the current font is
a MM itself font the menu also includes a list of all font instances
that make up this one. This menu is available in the [font
view](#fontview) and the [outline glyph
view](#outline-char).

### The menu as it appears in the font view

-   [Create MM](#Create)...
-   [MM Valid](#Valid)
-   [MM Info](#Info)...
-   [Blend to New Font](#NewFont)...
-   [MM Change Default Weights](#DefWeights)...

    * * * * *

-   \<sub font names\>

Create MM

Brings up the [multiple master dialog](../multiplemaster/) and allows
you to create your own multiple master font from scratch.

MM Valid

Checks that the current multiple master font can be saved. So each
master design must match in:

-   Contours
    -   There must be the same number of contours and
    -   each contour must have the same number of points and
    -   each spline on the contour must be the same type (ie it can't
        correspond to a straight line in one font and a curve in
        another)

-   References
    -   There must be the same number of references and
    -   Each corresponding reference must refer to the same encoding

-   Hints
    -   Same number of hints

-   HintMasks (Counter masks are not supported here)
    -   HintMasks at corresponding points must specify a corresponding
        set of hints

-   Kerning
    -   If a glyph kerns with another glyph in one font, then a
        corresponding kerning pair must exist in all designs

MM Info

Brings up the [multiple master dialog](../multiplemaster/) and allows
you to modify the current multiple master font.

Blend to New Font...

Allows you to create a blended version of the current multiple master
font set as a stand alone font.

MM Change Default Weights

Allows you to change the default weights assigned to each master design
used in blending the default instance of the font

* * * * *

\<sub font name\>

Clicking on a different sub font name in the menu will cause that
sub-font to be displayed instead of the current one. The subfonts are
the master designs and the default blended font.

### The menu as it appears in the outline glyph view

-   [MM Reblend](#Reblend)

    * * * * *

-   [View](#View)

    * * * * *

-   \<sub font names\>

MM Reblend

Reblends the default version of the current glyph

View

A submenu which allows you to choose which of the designs of this glyph
you want displayed in the background of the view

* * * * *

\<sub font name\>

Clicking on a different sub font name in the menu will cause the glyph
from that sub-font to be displayed instead of the current one. The
subfonts are the master designs and the default blended font.
