title: Select By Lookup Subtable
---

This dialog allows you to select glyphs which undergo a transformation
described in the selected lookup subtable.

There are three variants on how the search behaves:

1.  The selection will be set to whatever glyphs match the search
    criteria
2.  The selection will be expanded. Anything that was previously
    selected will remain so, and anything that matches the search
    criteria will become selected.
3.  The selection will be restricted. Only glyphs previously selected
    will be searched, the selection will be restricted to those which
    match
     So if you want to search for all ligatures containing both "f" and
    "i"...
     Search for ligatures containing "f" with "\<\*\> Select Results"
    set
     Then Search for ligatures containing "i" with \<\*\> Restrict
    Selection" set
