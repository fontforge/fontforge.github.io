title: The Kerning Pairs dialog
---

This dialog either displays all kerning pairs in the entire font, or all
kerning pairs associated with a character (if it is invoked from the
outline view).

You may choose at what pixel size to view the pairs. Each pair is drawn
kerned so you can see at a glance those that are too close. Underneath
the pair is the kerning offset.

You may change the kerning by moving the mouse to the right hand
character of a pair, depressing the button and moving the character
around. The display is updated as you move it. All kern offsets that
have been changed will be displayed in red (in the example at right, the
"AT" pair has been changed).

You may select a kern pair by clicking on them. Once a selection has
been made you may use the up and down arrows to step to the next or
previous pair. For more accurate positioning you may alter the kerning
by using the left or right arrows, each alters the kerning by one unit
(if you hold down the shift or control keys and use the arrows the
kerning is altered by 10 units).

You may double click on a kern pair to get the [Kern Pair
Closeup](../metricsview/#kernpair) dlg.

You may undo the last change by pressing \^Z. You may revert the
currently selected pair to its original value by pressing Meta-Z
(Alt-Z).

You may control the order in which the kerning pairs are displayed, they
may be sorted by:

-   The left hand character first and the right hand character second
-   The right hand character first and the left hand character second
-   The (absolute value of the) kerning offset

If you type a character (or use [F12 to get characters you can't
type](../metricsview/#Entering)), then the dlg will scroll to display
the pairs associated with that character. The behavior depends in an
obvious way on how the dlg is sorted.
