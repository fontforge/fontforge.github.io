Curve

If all the selected points are Curve points then this entry will be
checked. Selecting it will change all selected points to be Curve
points.

Corner

If all the selected points are Corner points then this entry will be
checked. Selecting it will change all selected points to be Corner
points.

Tangent

If all the selected points are Tangent points then this entry will be
checked. Selecting it will change all selected points to be Tangent
points.

Make First

If exactly one point is selected and it is on a closed path and it is
not the "first point" of that path, then it will become the first point.

Can Be Interpolated

Can't Be Interpolated

When editing truetype curves, an on-curve point can be omitted from the
point list that is stored in the output font if it happens to be exactly
midway between its two control points. This makes for slightly smaller
files and is generally a good thing. However if the point is
interpolated then it cannot be referred to in instructions (or reference
point matching), so on rare occasions you will need to be able to turn
off this interpolation.

Add Anchor Point...

![](img/agetinfo.png)This command adds a new [anchor
point](overview.html#Anchors) to the glyph. The last click in the window
provides a default location for the point.

See [the overview](overview.html#Anchors) and the [Element-\>Get Info
command](../getinfo/#Anchors) for more info.

Acceptable Extrema

Tells the validator that it is OK for this spline to have extrema. You
select a spline by selecting its two end-points.

Make Line

If two adjacent points are selected then make the spline between them
into a straight line. If two points are selected and they are the
endpoints of their respective (open) contours, then join them with a
line. If a point is selected and has no adjacent selected points then
make its control points be on top of the point

Make Arc

If two adjacent points are selected then make the spline between them
into an elliptical arc. If two points are selected and they are the
endpoints of their respective (open) contours, then join them with an
elliptical arc.

FontForge chooses an ellipse which runs through the two points and is
tangent to the slope at those points. This is not enough information to
determine an ellipse (three points and two tangents are needed) so in
general there will be an infinite number of solutions, thus FontForge
may not pick the one you had your heart set on.

It is also possible to specify a set of input constraints which cannot
be met by any ellipse.

FontForge will first search for ellipses so that one of the selected
points lies one of the axes of the ellipse. If it can't find one like
that it will perform a more general search.

(If you hold down the \<Alt\> key when you select the menu item, then
FontForge will place a copy of the full ellipse into the background
layer -- this was for debugging, but I thought it kind of cool so I left
it in).

Insert Point on Spline at...

Select the two end-points of a spline, then bring up this dialog. You
can request that FontForge insert a point on the selected spline with
either a given X or a given Y coordinate.

Center Between Control Points

In truetype, if an on-curve point is centered between its control
points, then that point may be omitted when written to the output file.
This command allows you to create such a point more easily.

Name Contour

A contour may be named. This is designed for use in the Guide line (and
Background) layer. You can attach a mnemonic name to a guide line (like
"X-Height" or "Cap-Height" or whatever strikes your fancy).

Make Clip Path

Only meaningful in Type3 fonts. For a more complete description see the
section on [Type3 editing](../multilayer/#ClipPath). The clipping path
will be set to any selected contour(s) in the glyph. If no contour is
selected then there will be no clipping path.
