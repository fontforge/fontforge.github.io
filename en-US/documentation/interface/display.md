![](img/DisplayFonts.png)This dialog allows you to display text in any fonts
you have loaded into FontForge and see how they look on the screen and
together. Having done that to your satisfaction you may optionally print
the result.

The textarea should behave like any of FontForge's textarea's (except
this one is a lot slower to respond than others), it also allows you to
select any piece of text in it and change the font, point size and what
OpenType features should be applied to that text.

First make a selection (or type \^A to select everything), then choose
which font you want and how you want it dsplayed.

You may also select how the font is rasterized. The first three choices
(pfb, ttf, otf) will be rasterized by freetype, and the display is very
similar to that used by X (so this is an easy way of checking how your
fonts will look on the screen without going to the bother of installing
them.). The various options specify in what format the font is passed to
freetype:

-   pfb -- PostScript Type 1 font
-   ttf -- Truetype font
-   otf -- OpenType (PostScript Type 2) font

The "bitmap" option allows you to pick from any of the generated bitmap
(or greymap) fonts that have already been generated and reside in the
database.

The "fontforge" option will invoke FontForge's own rasterizer.
FontForge's rasterizer generates appallingly bad bitmaps.

You can choose whether you want the font to be antialiased or not.

And different bits of text can have different settings, so you can
compare them and decide which is least worse. Also you can compare two
different fonts and see how well they work together.

As with the [metrics view](../metricsview/)you may set the script and
language of the selected text and then choose which features to apply.
Note that if you start typing text in a different script you will
probably have to change it manually -- FontForge expects you to set the
script explicitly. On the upper left is a list of OpenType features (and
Apple feature/settings) which will be applied to the selected text.

Unlike the metrics view, fontforge will attempt to do baseline alignment
if the font being displayed has [horizontal baseline
information.](../elementmenu/#HBase)

FontForge tries to guess the appropriate dots per inch for your display
-- it may not get it right (X doesn't always know it either). If it
doesn't and the text looks too big or too small you may adjust it
manually.

This display is not modal, so you can edit your font while it is up.
However FontForge does not update the display everytime you make a
change, if you wish your changes to be reflected in the display you must
press the `[Refresh]` button. (If you make a severe change, like
removing a glyph from the font, please, please, please press this button
or FontForge may crash if you try to display something which is no
longer there).

There is a popup menu on the right mouse button.

You may Import text from a file. The file must either be in the current
local encoding, or UCS4 (unicode) or UTF8 (unicode). If it is in unicode
the first character in the file must be U+FEFF. You can also save the
contents of the field into a file (it will be in UTF8 and preceded by
U+FEFF) by typing \^S.

You can also generate an image of this window by typing Ctl-Shft-S.

Once you have edited in this window to your satisfaction you may print
the result. FontForge will produce either PostScript or PDF output (If
your fonts are originally truetype they will be output with a PostScript
wrapper around them so PostScript can deal with them).

![](img/Print.png)There are other printing options too. At the top of the
dialog are a set of tabs "Display" and "Print". The "Print" pane allows
you to print certain standard displays of a single font.

-   All the characters of your font, in a rectangular grid:
     ![](img/FontDisplay.png)
-   Certain selected characters, one per page, at a scale to fill up the
    page
     ![](img/CharPrint.png)
-   Certain selected characters at various pointsizes (72, 48, 36, 24,
    20, 18, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7.5, 7, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 5,
    4.5, 4)
     ![](img/MultiPrint.png)
-   Or the edited display from the other pane.
     ![](img/FontSample.png)

![](img/Print.png)The print pane appears again at right. The three choices
are reflected by the radio buttons (the Full Page Character and Multi
Size Character buttons will print any selected characters in the font
view, the current character in the outline view, and any characters
displayed in the metrics view -- they will be greyed out if no
characters are selected in the font view).

The PointSize field applies to the Full Font Display.

The Setup button allows you to pick a printer, pagesize, etc.

![](img/PageSetup.png)You may choose to queue the result with lp or lpr, you
may also direct it to ghostview, or simply print to a file. Files may be
written in either postscript or pdf formats (if you send output to a
file you will be prompted for a filename after you click OK in the Print
(not the PageSetup) dialog). You can also direct the print run to any
command you choose (the "Other" option). This command must expect to
find a postscript file on its standard input, if the command needs any
arguments (a common example might be the "-" used by many commands to
make them read standard input) they should be placed in the text field
with the command name.

FontForge knows about certain standard sizes of paper. If you want to
use a size which isn't on the list then enter it as 8.5x11in or
21x29.7cm.

FontForge will read your printcap file to get a list of printers. It
also adds one magic entry "\<default\>" if you select this (or if you
leave the printer blank) then lp or lpr will chose their default
printer.

The Printer and Copies arguments are not meaningful when using ghostview
or printing to a file.

Obviously my samples are based on european and CJK character sets. If
anyone has a small section of text in any language not represented
please send me a copy. Copyright free, of course, and preferably in a
unicode encoding...
