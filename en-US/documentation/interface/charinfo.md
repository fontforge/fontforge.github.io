This dialog allows you to set the name and unicode encoding of a given
glyph. If you know the name of the glyph then FontForge can tell you the
encoding (if you press Set From Name), similarly if you know the
encoding then FontForge can tell you the name.

The name field contains a pull down list with (possibly) several
synonyms for the name of this unicode code point.

It is possible to have one glyph assigned to two unicode code points
(This is not recommended, but it is possible). If you wish to do this
you may enter additional unicode values in the "`Alternate Unicode`"
area (set the variation selector to 0).

Adobe has proposed an extension to OpenType to support unicode variation
selectors in the 'cmap' table (traditionally they have been done as
ligatures in the 'GSUB' table). If you wish to take advantage of this
mechanism you can also use the "`Alternate Unicode/Variation`" section
to add 'cmap' data. If you wish the current glyph to be the default
variation for this font (the one that appears in the unicode encoding
subtable), then set the `Unicode Value` field above to the desired code
point and add an entry with the same code point and the appropriate
variation selector (as in the example above).

However if this glyph is not going to be the default glyph for this code
point, then set the `Unicode Value `field to -1, while entering the
appropriate code point and variation selector below.

The Glyph class field is for the opentype 'GDEF' table. You can usually
leave it set to automatic. FontForge will then figure out the class, and
whether it should be output into GDEF. You can see what FontForge does
in [View-\>Show ATT](../showatt/).

The `[] Mark for Unlink, Remove Overlap Before Save` checkbox sounds
absurdly complicated. Consider the glyphs Aring, Ccedilla, and Oogonek.
In traditional design the accent of each of these glyphs will overlap
the base letter. Unfortunately neither TrueType nor PostScript allows
contours to intersect. You can solve this problem by unlinking the
references that make up the glyph and then running Element-\>Remove
Overlap. But that has problems of its own... now when you change the
base letter (or the accent) the change will no longer be reflected in
the composite glyph. This little checkbox neatly solves that problem. If
the glyph is composed of references which overlap, and you wish to
retain the references, but you wish it to be output without an overlap,
simply check this box. Then when it comes time to save the font, ff will
perform the unlink and then run remove overlap, save the font, and then
restore the glyph to its original condition.

![](img/charinfo-comment.png)You can assign an arbitrary (unicode) comment
to the glyph. Simply type any text into this field. The comment is for
your use, it will not go into any generated fonts. You may also assign a
color to a glyph to make it stand out in the font view.

![](img/charinfo-pos.png)There are 6 separate sub-dialogs to help you edit
the [lookups](../lookups/) of the [GPOS and GSUB](../gposgsub/) tables
(some of these data can be converted into various of Apple's AAT tables,
particularly 'morx'). Lookups and their subtables are described in some
detail [here](overview.html#Lookups), and may be manipulated and created
with the [Element-\>Font Info](../fontinfo/#Lookups) commmand.

The first of sub-dialogs is the alternate position pane which allows you
to associate certain modifications to a glyph's metrics with a feature
in the GPOS table.

In the example at right the first lookup subtable (which is associated
with the Scientific Inferiors feature) will move the y position of the
glyph down by 900 em-units, while the second subtable will move it down
by 560 em-units. Positioning subtables can also move glyphs horizontally
and can adjust the horizontal and vertical advances of the glyph. If you
have configured FontForge to support them you can also add device tables
for pixel level corrections to these adjustments. Most subtables will
use only a few of the possibilities open to them and FontForge generally
hides unused columns -- but if you want to see them just turn off [\*]
Hide Unused Columns.

A new entry in the list may be created by pressing the \<New\> button
and a popup menu will appear with all possible lookup subtables you
could add data to.

The pairwise positioning sub-dialog allows you to change the positions
of two glyphs when they occur next to one another -- better know as
kerning. I think the [Metrics View](../metricsview/)provides a better
place to do kerning, but you can do it here if you wish.

![](img/charinfo-subs.png) A simple substitution replaces one glyph with
another. Here the glyph "one" has a series of substitutions to various
glyphs depending on what lookup subtable is invoked.

The multiple and alternate substitution sub-dialogs are very similar to
this one except that they can take multiple glyph names. In a multiple
substitution subtable each glyph is replaced by several other glyphs
(sort of the reverse of a ligature), while in the alternate substitution
sub-dialog each glyph is to be replaced by exactly one glyph from a list
and the user is to be given a choice as to which glyph is to be chosen.

![](img/charinfo-lig.png) The ligature pane allows you to tell FontForge
that the current glyph is a ligature composed of several other glyphs.
FontForge will sometimes be able to fill this in with the right default
value, but not always. The value should be a list of postscript glyph
names separated by spaces. If a glyph may be viewed as two different
ligatures then they may both be specified in different lines. For
example "ffi" may be viewed as a ligature of "f" "f" and "i" or of "ff"
and "i".



![](img/charinfo-counters.png) In complicated Asian glyphs, postscript has a
mechanism for controlling the width of counters between stems. These are
called counter mask hints![](img/newcountermask.png). In Latin, Cyrillic,
Greek fonts only glyphs like "m" are allowed to have counter masks, and
only in very controlled conditions. See the description of [counter
masks](../hinting/#Counter).

![](img/charinfo-counters.png) Some glyphs (ligatures, accented glyphs,
Hangul syllables, etc.) are built up out of other glyphs (at least
according to unicode). This pane of the dlg shows the components that
Unicode says make up the current glyph, if those components are in the
font then you can use FontForge's Element-\>Build-\>Build Accented or
Element-\>Build-\>Build Composite commands to create the current glyph.
The information displayed here is informative only, you may not change
this field directly (it changes when you change the unicode value or
glyph name associated with this glyph).

![](img/charinfo-tex.png) The TeX pane allows you to specify glyph specific
information used in TeX tmf files. The height and depth fields are often
the same as the glyph's bounding box (if you don't fill these in that's
what fontforge will use by default), but they should be corrected for
optical distortion, so in glyphs like "o" these fields should be clipped
to the x-height and baseline (ff will attempt to do this when you press
`[Guess]`).

The Italic correction is used by both TeX and the new OpenType
[MATH](../../reference/math/#Italic) table. In the MATH table you may also specify a
device table to correct rounding errors at small pixel sizes.

The Top Accent Position is another concept from the [MATH
table](../../reference/math/#TopAccent) and provides a horizontal position over
which to position math accents (vertical positioning is done somewhere
else).

For extremely tall glyphs the normal mechanisms for positioning
superscripts are inappropriate and the `[] Is Extended Shape` checkbox
alerts the typesetter to this fact.

The [Math Kerning] button brings up the [Math Kerning
dialog](../../reference/math/#MathKern) which gives you fine control over the
placement of subscripts and superscripts near the glyph.

### Variants

![](img/charinfo-variants.png)There are two panes for variants, one for
glyphs that get longer horizontally and one for glyphs that get longer
vertically.

In mathmatical typesetting the size of a parenthesis will depend on the
vertical size of the formula within that parenthesis. As formulae can be
arbetarily complex they may be arbetarily tall, so there needs to be a
way of making arbetarily big parentheses. This pane provides two
mechanisms.

At the top you may specify a list of prebuilt glyphs each a little
bigger than the one before.

Underneath you may specify a way of building really big parentheses by
combining several component glyphs. See the description of this in the
[MATH Info dialog](../../reference/math/#GlyphConstruction)for more details.

### ![](img/charinfo-tilesize.png)Tile Size

This only applies when editing type3 fonts. Even then it is only
meaningful if the current glyph is used as a
[pattern](../multilayer/#Patterns) in some other glyph.

When a glyph is used as a pattern, the size of the pattern tile defaults
to the bounding box of the glyph used. This means there will be no
whitespace around the tile. Sometimes that is desirable (if the tiles
are to looks as though they touch), sometimes it is not. This provides
control over the whitespace that surrounds the drawn region of the tile.

You can specify that you want a constant margin of white space around
all edges of the tile, or you can specify explicitly the coordinates of
the tile.

The Next and Prev buttons allow you to move from one glyph to the next
(if, for example, you need to enter encodings for a range of glyphs).

The Cancel button now cancels all changes made with this instance of the
dialog.
