title: The Anchor Control dialog
---

![](img/anchorcontrol-base.png)You invoke this dialog from the outline glyph
view by selecting an anchor point in that glyph and selecting
`Metrics->Anchor Control`. In the example at right, the arabic letter
Hamza was chosen. In the first pane of the dialog are various controls,
next to that is a pane displaying the letter Hamza and showing the
anchor point relative to that letter. You may move the anchor point
around to position it as you wish.

After this there is a scrollable region containing multiple sub-panes.
Each sub-pane contains one combination of Hamza and a mark that fits on
top of it. If you click in one of these sub-panes, FontForge changes the
dialog to look at the mark you selected.![](img/anchorcontrol-mark.png) Here
we clicked on the Fathatan mark, and we now see all the base letters
that fit underneath it. This dialog now gives you control of the anchor
point in the Fathatan mark.

At the top of the control region is a pull down list containing the
names of all glyphs in this anchor class. You may look at the
combinations based on any of them. You may also use the Page Up and Page
Down keys to cycle through this list.

You may control the pixelsize used to display the combinations.
Sometimes it is important to get a close up view of a small pixelsize
(which may be quite different from looking at a larger pixelsize) and
the Magnification field allows for this.

You can also enter the anchor point's location by manual typing in the
X,Y textfields at right.

Device Tables
-------------

You can also create something called a "Device Table", a name which is
not very informative. When a font is rasterized at small pixel sizes
rounding errors become important, and this is particularly true of mark
positioning, where there are four things that get rounded: The locations
of the each glyph's outlines (to fit them to a pixel grid), and the
locations of the anchor points of each glyph. The result is that
something which looks perfectly positioned at 150pixels may be either
too close or too far apart at 12pixels.

You could adjust the anchor point's location slightly until it looked
right at 12pixels, of course, but that might break it at 14 pixels. So
OpenType has the concept of a Device Table which allows you to add small
corrections at particular point sizes. Simply set the Size to a small,
but common, value (say 10-24) and examine the positioning. If the
results are ugly then type a value into the appropriate `Cor`(rection)
field, and this will change the spacing by that many pixels at the given
display size (and no other).

Note it may sometimes be better to define a correction in the matching
glyph rather than the current one. Corrections will apply to all glyphs
matched with the current one.
