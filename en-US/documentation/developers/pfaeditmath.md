Linear Transformations
----------------------

A linear transformation is one where the spline described by
transforming the end and control points will match the transformed
spline. This includes most of the common transformations you might wish:

-   translation
      ------ --- ----------
      *x'*   =   *x + dx*
      *y'*   =   *y + dy*
      ------ --- ----------

-   scaling
      ------ --- -------------
      *x'*   =   *s~x~ \* x*
      *y'*   =   *s~y~ \* y*
      ------ --- -------------

-   rotation
      ------ --- --------------------------
      *x'*   =   *cos(A)\*x + sin(A)\*y*
      *y'*   =   *-sin(X)\*x + cos(A)\*y*
      ------ --- --------------------------

-   skewing
      ------ --- -----------------
      *x'*   =   *x + sin(A)\*y*
      *y'*   =   *y*
      ------ --- -----------------

* * * * *

Finding maxima and minima of a spline
-------------------------------------

The maximum or minimum of a spline (along either the x or y axes) may be
found by taking the first derivative of that spline with respect to t.
So if we have a spline

>         x = ax*t3 + bx*t2 + cx*t +dx
>         y = ay*t3 + by*t2 + cy*t +dy

and we wish to find the maximum point with respect to the x axis we set:

>         dx/dt = 0
>         3*ax*t2 + 2*bx*t + cx = 0
>      

and then using the quadratic formula we can solve for t:

t=

-2\*b~x~± sqrt(4\*b~x~^2^ - 4\*3\*a~x~\*c~x~)

-----------------------------------

2\*3\*a~x~

* * * * *

Finding points of inflection of a spline
----------------------------------------

A point of inflection occurs when d^2^y/dx^2^==0 (or infinity).

Unfortunately this does not mean that d^2^y/dt^2^==0 or d^2^x/dt^2^==0.

  -------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  d^2^y/dx^2^=   d/dt ((dy/dt)/(dx/dt)) / dx/dt
                 ( ((dx/dt) \* d^2^y/dt^2^) - ((dy/dt) \* d^2^x/dt^2^)) / (dx/dt)^3^
  -------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

After a lot of algebra this boils down to the quadratic in t:

  --------------------------------- ------------------------------------ --
                                    3\*(a~x~\*b~y~-a~y~\*b~x~)\*t^2^ +   
  3\*(c~x~\*a~y~-c~y~\*a~x~)\*t +   
  c~x~\*b~y~-c~y~\*b~x~             = 0
  --------------------------------- ------------------------------------ --

If you examine this closely you will note that a quadratic spline
(a~y~==a~x~==0) can never have a point of inflection.

Approximating a spline
----------------------

Many of FontForge's commands need to fit a spline to a series of points.
The most obvious of these are the Edit-\>Merge, and Element-\>Simplify
commands, but many others rely on the same technique. Let us consider
the case of the Merge command, suppose we have the following splines and
we wish to remove the middle point and generate a new spline that
approximates the original two:

      ![](img/mergepre.png) =\> ![](img/mergepost.png)

FontForge uses a least squares approximation to determine the new
spline. It calculates the locations of several points along the old
splines, and then it guesses^[1](#guess-t)^ at t values for those
points.

Now a cubic [Bézier](../../reference/bezier/) spline is determined by its two end
points (P~0~ and P~1~) and two control points (CP~0~ and CP~1~, which
specify the slope at those end points). Here we know the end points, so
all we need is to find the control points. The spline can also be
expressed as a cubic polynomial:

> S(t) = a\*t^3^ + b\*t^2^ + c\*t +d
>      -- with --
>  d = P0
>  c = 3\*CP0 - 3\*P0
>  b = 3\*CP1 - 6\*CP0 + 3\*P0
>  a = P1 - 3\*CP1 + 3\*CP0 - P0
>      substituting
>  S(t) = (P1 - 3\*CP1 + 3\*CP0 - P0)\*t^3^ +
>    (3\*CP1 - 6\*CP0 + 3\*P0)\*t^2^ +
>    (3\*CP0 - 3\*P0)\*t +
>    P0
>      rearranging
>  S(t) = (-3\*t^3^ + 3\*t^2^) \* CP1 +
>    (3\*t^3^ - 6\*t^2^ + 3\*t) \* CP0 +
>    (P1-P0)\*t^3^ + 3\*P0\*t^2^ - 3\*P0\*t + P0

Now we want to minimize the sum of the squares of the difference between
the value we approximate with the new spline, S(t~i~), and the actual
value we were given, P~i~.

  --------- --------------------- ----------------------
            ![](img/Sigma28x33.png)   [ S(t~i~) - P~i~]^2^
  --------- --------------------- ----------------------

Now we have four unknown variables, the x and y coordinates of the two
control points. To find the minimum of the above error term we must take
the derivative with respect to each variable, and set that to zero. Then
we have four equations with four unknowns and we can solve for each
variable.

  --------- --------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
            ![](img/Sigma28x33.png)   2\* (-3\*t^3^ + 3\*t^2^)\*[ S~x~(t~i~) - P~i.x~] = 0
            ![](img/Sigma28x33.png)   2\* (-3\*t^3^ + 3\*t^2^)\*[ S~y~(t~i~) - P~i.y~] = 0
            ![](img/Sigma28x33.png)   2\* (3\*t^3^ - 6\*t^2^ + 3\*t)\*[ S~x~(t~i~) - P~i.x~] = 0
            ![](img/Sigma28x33.png)   2\* (3\*t^3^ - 6\*t^2^ + 3\*t)\*[ S~y~(t~i~) - P~i.y~] = 0
  --------- --------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------

Happily for us, the x and y terms do not interact and my be solved
separately. The procedure is the same for each coordinate, so I shall
only show one:

  --------- --------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----
            ![](img/Sigma28x33.png)   2\* (-3\*t^3^ + 3\*t^2^)\*[ S~x~(t~i~) - P~i.x~] = 0

            ![](img/Sigma28x33.png)   2\* (3\*t^3^ - 6\*t^2^ + 3\*t)\*[ S~x~(t~i~) - P~i.x~] = 0

                                                                                                  (3\*t^3^ - 6\*t^2^ + 3\*t) \* CP0~x~ +\                                 
                                                                                                  (P1~x~-P0~x~)\*t^3^ + 3\*P0~x~\*t^2^ - 3\*P0~x~\*t + P0~x~ - P~i.x~ ]

  --------------------- --------------------------------------------
  ![](img/Sigma28x33.png)   (-3\*t^3^ + 3\*t^2^)\*(-3\*t^3^ + 3\*t^2^)
  --------------------- --------------------------------------------

Now this can be plugged into the other equation

  --------- --------------------- ------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----
            ![](img/Sigma28x33.png)   (3\*t^3^ - 6\*t^2^ + 3\*t)\*   [ (-3\*t^3^ + 3\*t^2^) \* CP1~x~ +\                                        = 0
                                                                    (3\*t^3^ - 6\*t^2^ + 3\*t) \* CP0~x~ +\                                 
                                                                    (P1~x~-P0~x~)\*t^3^ + 3\*P0~x~\*t^2^ - 3\*P0~x~\*t + P0~x~ - P~i.x~ ]   
  --------- --------------------- ------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

And we can solve for CP0~x~ and then CP1~x~. The algebra becomes very
messy, with lots of terms, but the concepts are simple.

Thus we know where the control points are. We know where the end points
are. We have our spline.

### Why that didn't (quite) work

The above matrix yields a curve which is a good approximation to the
original two. But it has one flaw: There is no constraint placed on the
slopes, and (surprisingly) the slopes at the end-points of the above
method are not close enough to those of the original, and the human eye
can now detect the join between this generated spline and the two that
connect to it.

Generally we will know the slopes at the end points as well as the end
points themselves.

Let's try another approach, based on better geometry. Givens:

-   the start point
-   the slope at the start point
-   the end point
-   the slope at the end point

We want to find the two control points. Now it may seem that specifying
the slope specifies the control point but this is not so, it merely
specifies the direction in which the control point lies. The control
point may be anywhere along the line through the start point in that
direction, and each position will give a different curve.

So we can express the control point by saying it is CP~0~ = P~0~ + r~0~
![](img/delta0.png) where ![](img/delta0.png) is a vector in the direction of
the slope, and r~0~ is the distance in that direction. Similarly for the
end point: CP~1~ = P~1~ + r~1~ ![](img/delta1.png)

We want to find r~0~ and r~1~.

Converting from bezier control points into a polynomial gives us
 S(t) = a\*t^3^ + b\*t^2^ + c\*t + d

-   d = P~0~
-   c = 3\*(CP~0~ - P~0~)
-   b = 3\*(CP~1~ - CP~0~) - c
-   a = P~1~-P~0~ - c - b

Substituting we get

-   d = P~0~
-   c = 3\*r~0~\*![](img/delta0.png)
-   b = 3\*(P~1~-P~0~+r~1~\*![](img/delta1.png)-2\*r~0~![](img/delta0.png))
-   a = 2\*(P~0~-P~1~) + 3\*(r~0~![](img/delta0.png) -
    r~1~\*![](img/delta1.png))

For least squares we want to minimize ![](img/Sigma13x16.png)(S(t~i~) -
P~i~)^2^.
 taking derivatives with both r0 and r1 we get:

  --------- --------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------ --------- --------------------- ------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------- ------- --------- --------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------- -------
            ![](img/Sigma28x33.png)   2\* (3\*t^3^ - 6\*t^2^ + 3\*t)\*![](img/delta0.png)\*[ S(t~i~) - P~i~] = 0

            ![](img/Sigma28x33.png)   2\* (-3\*t^3^ + 3\*t^2^)\*![](img/delta1.png)\*[ S(t~i~) - P~i~] = 0         dividing by constants and substituting, we get             ![](img/Sigma28x33.png)   (3\*t^3^ - 6\*t^2^ + 3\*t)\*[   P~0~ - P~i~ + 3 \* (P~1~-P~0~\*t^2^ + 2 \* (P~0~ - P~1~)\*t^3^ +\   ] = 0             ![](img/Sigma28x33.png)   (-3\*t^3^ + 3\*t^2^)\*[   P~0~ - P~i~ + 3 \* (P~1~-P~0~\*t^2^ + 2 \* (P~0~ - P~1~)\*t^3^ +\   ] = 0
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ![](img/delta0.png)\*(3\*t - 6\*t^2^ + 3\*t^3^) \* r~0~ + \                                                                               ![](img/delta0.png)\*(3\*t - 6\*t^2^ + 3\*t^3^) \* r~0~ + \            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ![](img/delta1.png)\*(3\*t^2^ - 3\*t^3^) \* r~1~ +                                                                                        ![](img/delta1.png)\*(3\*t^2^ - 3\*t^3^) \* r~1~ +                     
  --------- --------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------ --------- --------------------- ------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------- ------- --------- --------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------- -------

Again we have two linear equations in two unknowns (r0, and r1), and
(after a lot of algebraic grubbing) we can solve for them. One
interesting thing here is that the x and y terms do not separate but
must be summed together.

### Singular matrices

Very occasionally, a singular matrix will pop out of these equations.
Then what I do is calculate the slope vectors at the endpoints and then
try many reasonable lengths for those vectors and see which yields the
best approximation to the original curve (this gives us our new control
points).

This is very, very slow.

* * * * *

#### ^1^Guessing values for t

FontForge approximates the lengths of the two splines being merged. If
Point~i~= Spline1(old-t~i~), then we approximate ti by
     t~i~ = old-t~i~ \*len(spline1)/(len(spline1)+len(spline2)
 and if Point~i~= Spline2(old-t~i~)
     t~i~ = len(spline1)/(len(spline1)+len(spline2) + old-t~i~
\*len(spline2)/(len(spline1)+len(spline2)
 That is we do a linear interpolation of t based on the relative lengths
of the two splines.

* * * * *

Calculating the outline of a stroked path
-----------------------------------------

### A circular pen

PostScript supports several variants on the theme of a circular pen, and
FontForge tries to emulate them all. Basically PostScript "stroke"s a
path at a certain width by:

at every location on the curve
     find the normal vector at that location
     find the two points which are width/2 away from the curve
     filling in between those two points
 end

This is essentially what a circular pen does. The only aberrations
appear at the end-points of a contour, or at points where two splines
join but their slopes are not continuous. PostScript allows the user to
specify the behavior at joints and at end-points.

    ![](img/expand-pre.png) =\> ![](img/expand-post.png)

FontForge can't deal with an infinite number of locations, so it samples
the curve (approximately every em unit), and finds the two normal
points. These are on the edge of the area to be stroked, so FontForge
can approximate new contours from these edge points (using the [above
algorithm](#Approximating)).

PostScript pens can end in

-   A flat edge -- this is easy, we just draw a line from the end of one
    spline to the end of the other
-   A rounded edge -- here we just draw a semi-circle (making sure it
    goes in the right direction).
-   A butt edge -- just draw lines continuing the two splines, moving
    with the same slope and width/2 units long, and then join those
    end-points with a straight line.

Things are a bit more complex at a joint ![](img/expand-joint-pre.png) =\>
![](img/expand-joint-post.png), the green lines in the right image show
where the path would have gone had it not been constrained by a joint,
so on the inside of the joint FontForge must figure out where this
intersection occurs. While on the outside FontForge must figure out
either a round, miter or bevelled edge.

Unfortunately, the normal points are not always on the edge of the
filled region. If the curve makes a sharp bend, then one of the normal
points may end up inside the pen when it is centered somewhere else on
the original contour (similar to the case of a joint above).

So FontForge makes another pass through the edge points and figures out
which ones are actually internal points. After that it will approximate
contours.

Now if we start with an open contour, (a straight line, for example)
then we will end up with one closed contour. While if we start with a
closed contour we will end up with two closed contours (one on the
inside, and one on the outside). Unless there are places where the curve
doubles back on itself, then when can get arbetrarily many closed
contours.

### An elliptical pen

This is really just the same as a circular pen. Let us say we want an
ellipse which is twice as wide as it is high. Then before stroking the
path, let's scale it to 50% in the horizontal direction, then stroke it
with a circular pen, and then scale it back by 200% horizontally. The
result will be as if we had used an elliptical pen.

Obviously if the ellipse is at an angle to the glyph's axes, we must
apply a more complicated transformation which involves both rotation and
scaling.

### A rectangular pen (a calligraphic pen)

Things are subtly different between a rectangular pen and a circular
pen. We can no longer just find the points which are a given distance
away and normal to the curve. Except where the spline is parallel to one
edge of the pen, a the outer contour of a rectangular pen will be
stroked by one of its end-points. So all we need do is figure out where
a spline is parallel to the pen's sides, and look at the problem in
little chunks between those difficult points.

If we are between difficult points then life is very simple indeed. The
edge will always be stroked by the same end-point, which is a fixed
distance from the center of the pen, so all we need to do is translate
the original spline by this distance (and then fix it up so that t goes
from [0,1], but that's another easy transformation).

When we reach a point where the spline's slope is parallel to one edge
of the pen, then on the outside path we draw a copy of that edge of of
the pen, and on the inside edge we calculate a join as above.

### An arbitrary convex polygonal pen

The same method which works for a rectangle can be extended without too
much difficulty to any convex polygon. (MetaFont fonts can be drawn with
such a pen. I don't know if any are)

### A pen of variable width

FontForge does not currently support this (some of the assumptions
behind this algorithm are broken if the pen changes shape too rapidly).

### A pen at a varying angle

FontForge does not support this.
