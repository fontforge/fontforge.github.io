title: Auto Width and Auto Kern

Auto Width![](img/autowidth.png)
----------------------------

The Auto Width command will attempt to guess reasonable widths (more
accurately reasonable left and right side bearings) for your font. The
command splits the selection into scripts and looks at all possible
combinations of selected glyphs within each script.

The Separation text box allows you to say how close you want the glyphs
to be. If you look at a vertical bar (or sanserif "I"), and you
autowidth it the sum of the left and right side bearings will be equal
to the spacing. The min and max values will prevent sidebearings from
becoming unrealistically large (these rarely matter).

Adjusting the left and right bearings of a letter will also adjust the
left and right bearings of all accented letters based (by reference) on
it. You should not try to use AutoWidth on accented letters directly
(unless those glyphs do not use references).

Auto Kern
---------

There used to be an Auto Kern dialog. There is no longer, this is now
done in the [kerning subtable](../../interface/lookups/#Pair) dialog and the
[kerning class](../../interface/metricsview/#kernclass)dialog.

### The python `GlyphSeparationHook`

When FontForge does AutoKerning (and in a more complicated fashion, when
it does AutoWidthing) it tries to guess the optical separation between
two glyphs, and then it applies an appropriate kern value to make the
optical separation be the desired spacing.

FontForge assumes that the optical spacing is linear (so if you increase
the separation between two glyphs by 3 em-units, then the optical
spacing will also increase by 3 em-units).

FF guesses the optical separation between two glyphs by figuring a value
for the separation of two glyphs when their bounding boxes are adjacent.
For two rectangles (where the bounding box is the same as the glyph
itself) the separation will be 0 as the two glyphs will be touching. For
a combination like "To" the optical separation will be quite large.

  ------------------------------ ----------------------

The GlyphSeparationHook is a python routine which will be called with a
bunch of information about two glyphs, and is expected to return an
integer representing the optical separation between the two. It is a
low-level routine; the actual calculation of kerning offsets or setting
glyph widths is done elsewhere, but this routine provides the
information those higher level routines need. Of course, if you don't
provide a routine, FontForge has a built-in routine which will provide a
default behavior. Here is a python version of that default routine:

The hook will be called with three arguments, a structure with
information about the glyph on the left, a structure with information
about the glyph on the right, and a structure containing general
information about the operation as a whole.

The context argument contains the following fields:

  -------------- -----------------------------------------------
  font           The font being worked on
  emSize         The emsize of the font
  layer          The active layer for this operation
  regionHeight   (explained below) by default emSize/100
  denom          1/50th of the emSize. A number I found handy.
  -------------- -----------------------------------------------

FontForge preprocess all the glyphs, extracting pertinant information
from each and storing it in a separate per-glyph structure than the
normal python Glyph object. The most important information is a
representation of the leftmost and rightmost edges of the glyph.
Basically, for every value of y, FontForge finds the smallest x
coordinate on any of the glyph's contours at that height and stores that
information in an array. There is a similar array containing the largest
x coordinates. Of course there are an infinite number of y values, so
that isn't quite accurate. FontForge divides the vertical axis into many
regions, each regionHeight high (this is usually 1/100th of the emsize).
It then finds the smallest x coordinate achieved by any contour within
that region.

The value stored in the array representing the leftmost edge of the
glyph is not quite the smallest x coordinate. Instead we normalize the
numbers so that the x coordinate of the left side bearing of the glyph
is 0. None of the numbers in the left array will be negative.

Similarly the value stored in the rightmost array is normalized so that
the glyph's right side bearing is 0. None of the numbers in the right
array will be positive.

There can be gaps in a glyph -- for example in a lower case "i" there is
a hole in the body of the glyph between the dot on top and the rest down
below. In this case the left array will hold the special value 32767,
and the right array will hold -32767.

So I don't pass a standard glyph object. The underlying glyph object can
be obtained through the `glyph` member. The most important things in
this structure are the arrays representing the left and right contours
called `left` and `right`. The structure also contains the upper and
lower bounds of the arrays (both arrays have the same bounds). The glyph
structures contain the following members:

  ------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  glyph         This is the standard python glyph object. This can (rarely) be None.
  boundingbox   A tuple of 4 values (minx,miny,maxx,maxy) for the glyph
  iminY         The low bound of the arrays.
  imaxY         The high bound of the arrays
  left          an array of integers representing the separation between the left edge of the bounding box and the leftmost contour at that height (never negative)
  right         an array of integers representing the separation between the right edge of the bounding box and the rightmost contour at that height (never positive)
  ------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`iminY` and `imaxY` are scaled by `regionHeight` from the y units in the
glyph itself. The value contain at left[0] would represent minimum
separation between boundingbox.minx and any the x location of any
contour when the y location was between 0 and regionHeight. Similarly
left[1] would be the minimum separation with the y location between
regionHeight and 2\*regionHeight. And so forth.

>         imin_y = max(onRight.iminY,onLeft.iminY);
>         imax_y = min(onRight.imaxY,onLeft.imaxY);
>         if imax_y < imin_y :
>         return( 0 )

Here we figure out the range along the y axis where the glyphs both
exist. If the two glyphs don't share any area along the y axis (as, for
example, the glyph "a" and the grave accent might not) then we assume
they do not interact and return a visual separation of 0.

>         tot,cnt = 0,0
>         j = imin_y
>         while j<=imax_y :
>         if onRight.left[j] < 32767 and onLeft.right[j] > -32767 :
>             sep = onRight.left[j] - onLeft.right[j]
>             weight = 1.0/(sep + context.denom)
>             weight *= weight
>             tot += weight*sep
>             cnt += weight
>         j += 1

Otherwise loop over the y range where both glyphs are active. Checking
to make sure there are no holes.

We find the actual separation between the two glyphs at this y value.

Then we calculate some magic weighting function (this is handwaving.
your routine will have a better weighting function)

>         if cnt!=0 :
>         tot /= cnt
>         return( int(round( tot )) );

And finally we take the weighted average of those separations, and
return that as the optical separation.

>     fontforge.registerGlyphSeparationHook(GlyphSeparation)

And this routine will tell FontForge to use the hook you provide.
