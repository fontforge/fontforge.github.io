Special thoughts for special scripts
------------------------------------

[Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/specs/default.htm)
provides some information on what (opentype) features a word processor
should support by default for certain scripts.

**Caveat:** Just because a feature is documented and looks useful does
not mean Uniscribe will use it for your script. Many Latin script fonts
would like to use 'init', 'medi', 'calt', etc. but none of these
features is turned on by Uniscribe for Latin.

**Caveat:** Just because Uniscribe supports a feature that does not mean
any given application will. Uniscribe (as of 2005) supports 'liga' for
latin, but neither Word nor Office does.

**Caveat:** Uniscribe (MS unicode text layout routines) may ignore
either the GPOS or the GSUB table depending on the script, and may even
refuse to use the font at all if it doesn't have the right stuff in
GPOS/GSUB. A Hebrew font must have both a GPOS and a GSUB. If it doesn't
the font is not used. A latin font need not have either, but if it
doesn't have GSUB then GPOS won't be used. So now if one table is
present and the other isn't, FontForge will generate a dummy version of
the other.

### Common

Many characters are used in more than one script. The digits, marks of
punctuation, etc. are said in Unicode to belong to the script "Common".
OpenType does not recognize this script. The closest thing it has is the
script 'DFLT'. My understanding is that characters in the common script
will have the script of adjacent text assigned to them by OpenType.

Thus if a font supports latin, greek or cyrillic then digits and
punctuation might find themselves in any of those three scripts and all
features which apply to any such character should be present in all
scripts. For example if the digit 9 kerns with digit 1, then that
kerning data should be present in cyrillic and greek as well as latin.

However it is possible (and I gather common in Japanese) to use the
digits from one font surrounded by Kanji characters from another font.
This means the digits may be in a font which does not support Kanji.
However OpenType will assign them the Kanji script. Thus no lookups will
be applied. Adobe suggests that for most features in scripts should also
appear in the fallback script 'DFLT'. I'm not sure that anyone else
follows this convention.

### Latin

Uniscribe supports the [following
features](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/standard/shaping.mspx)

There are not many special complications in latin. Latin fonts can
generally fit in a single byte encoding with no (or few) font tables.
There are a plethora of accented glyphs which could be built -- or you
could use mark to base positioning. Kerning should be generated for some
glyph combinations. A few ligatures need to be generated (the "f"
ligatures: ff, fi, fl, ffi, ffl and perhaps st -- however for some
languages (Turkish) the "fi" ligature should not be built).

You may want to add a set of smallcaps. Adobe has reserved a block in
the private use area for latin small-caps -- this is now depreciated.

Some languages have specific requirements of their own

### Greek

Uniscribe supports the [following
features](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/standard/shaping.mspx)

Greek also does not have many complications. Modern Greek fonts
generally fit in a single byte encoding. For modern greek are a few
accented glyphs that need to be built, while for polytonic greek there
are many -- mark to base & mark to mark are options. Kerning should be
generated. I am not aware of any standard ligatures for modern greek
(ancient greek had ligatures and variants on some of the glyphs though).

Small caps are again an option, and I have reserved a block in the
private use area for them -- again this is depreciated.

### Cyrillic

Uniscribe supports the [following
features](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/standard/shaping.mspx)

Cyrillic fonts also fit in a single byte encoding. There are a few
accented glyphs. Kerning should be generated. I am not aware of any
standard ligatures.

Some languages need variant glyphs (specified with a 'loca' feature)

### Arabic

Uniscribe supports the [following
features](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/arabic/shaping.mspx)

Arabic needs a complete set of initial, medial, final and isolated forms
-- Unicode has reserved space for these. Arabic also needs a vast set of
ligatures -- Unicode has reserved space for many, but I'd guess that
extra ligatures will be needed sometimes. Arabic also needs a set of
mark (mark to base, mark to ligature) attachments to position vowels
above letters. Arabic may need a glyph decomposition table.

I'm told that in good Arabic typography there need to be many more than
4 forms per glyph. I'm not sure how this should be supported.

### Hebrew

Uniscribe supports the [following
features](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/hebrew/shaping.mspx)

Hebrew has a few final forms but no special tables are needed for these.
Hebrew may need kerning. Hebrew should have a set of mark (mark to base)
tables to position vowels over letters. Hebrew may need a glyph
decomposition table. I am not aware of any needed ligatures.

### Indic scripts

Uniscribe supports the [following
features](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otfntdev/indicot/shaping.aspx)

Indic scripts need a set of ligatures.

(they probably need a lot more but I'm not aware of what)

### Korean Hangul

Uniscribe supports the [following
features](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/hangul/shaping.mspx)

The Hangul script consists of a set of syllables built out of a phonetic
alphabet. Generally fonts consist of a set of precomposed syllables.

Complications are introduced by the massive combinatorial explosion of
all these syllables. These are eased in postscript by CID-keyed fonts.

Vertical writing and left to right writing are used, and some glyphs
have a different orientation when drawn vertically (parentheses for
example).

### Japanese and Chinese (and Korean Hanja)

MicroSoft does not describe these scripts (that I can find).

Again a massive collection of glyphs is needed, and postscript uses CID
keyed fonts to deal with this.

Vertical writing and left to right writing are used, and some glyphs
have a different orientation when drawn vertically (parentheses for
example).
