Opening & Importing Bitmap strikes
----------------------------------

FontForge is primarily an outline font editor, but it does have some
facility for editing bitmap (and greymap, or anti-aliased) fonts. A
useful term here is a "strike"; a strike is one particular size of a
bitmap font. When FontForge displays a font, that font will contain at
most one outline but potentially many bitmap (or greymap) strikes (for
several different pixel sizes).

You might wonder if it is really necessary to provide bitmaps along with
outlines given the high quality results of modern rasterizers, and for
Latin (Greek, Cyrillic) fonts it may not be, but for CJK fonts at small
pixel sizes a human eye can still make a better choice than even the
best rasterizer. Back in the 1980s when Apple first adopted PostScript
fonts they felt it was essential to have bitmaps to go with the outline
-- so much so that it was not even possible to use a PostScript font
without also providing at least one bitmap with it. Even today, when
using a Type1 font on a mac there must be a bitmap font to point to it.

Of course Type1 fonts are a bit old-fashioned now, but the sfnt file
format (the format used for both OpenType and TrueType fonts) supports
embedded bitmap strikes along with the outline version of the font.
These strikes will be used in preference to rasterizing the outline in
any pixel sizes for which they are present.

If you have an sfnt with both an outline font and bitmap strikes you can
open it directly with the [File-\>Open](../../documentation/interface/filemenu/#Open) command and
FontForge will load all the bits and pieces.

You can also open a bitmap only font directly with the
[File-\>Open](../../documentation/interface/filemenu/#Open) command, however if you have multiple
strikes of the same underlying font in separate files, you will probably
want to open only the first (or only the outline version) with Open, and
use [File-\>Import](../../documentation/interface/filemenu/#Import) to merge the other strikes
into one FontForge font.

Suppose you have `Ambrosia.pfb` (an outline font), `Ambrosia-12.bdf`,
and `Ambrosia-24.bdf `(two bitmap strikes, one 12 pixels high, one 24),
and you want them all in one font. First use
[File-\>Open](../../documentation/interface/filemenu/#Open) to open Ambrosia.pfb, then
[File-\>Import](../../documentation/interface/filemenu/#Import) and select both of the bitmap
strikes (hold down the shift key).

On the other hand, if you have only two bitmaps: `Ambrosia-12.bdf`, and
`Ambrosia-24.bdf`, then use [File-\>Open](../../documentation/interface/filemenu/#Open) to open
either strike, and use [File-\>Import](../../documentation/interface/filemenu/#Import) and import
the other.

You may have noticed that Import has a checkbox labeled
`[] As   Background`. If you check this, then your bitmap font will not
be loaded as a font itself, but will be loaded into the background of
the outline font whence you can `Element->Autotrace` it to provide an
outline font from a bitmap. Be warned: This produces fairly bad results
unless you have a large (100+ pixel) font to trace.

Creating Bitmap strikes
-----------------------

![](img/bitmapsavail.png)If you want to add a bitmap strike with a given
pixel size to a font then use `Element->Bitmap Strikes   Available`.
Simply add the pixel size you are interested in to the list at the
bottom of the screen.

If you are more comfortable dealing in point sizes, be aware that those
depend on screen resolution. This dialog shows you the conversion
between point and pixel sizes for two standard resolutions. The
resolutions differ depending on what windowing system you use.

You may add more than one pixel size, of course. You may also remove
pixel sizes if you no longer want them.

Normally when you create a new strike it will be rasterized from the
outline font -- if there is no outline font then FontForge will attempt
to scale the biggest strike available to the new size (in most cases
this will be fairly ugly, but it may be better than nothing.

There is also a checkbox
`[*] Create Rasterized Strikes (Not empty   ones)` at the bottom of the
dialog. If you turn this off, then the rasterization process described
above will not happen, and any new strikes will be created containing no
glyphs (you can add glyphs later, of course).

Bitmap Properties
-----------------

In the old days of bdf and pcf fonts on X11 each font had a set of
properties attached to it. It is not clear to me whether these
properties are still useful as X11 moves to OpenType Bitmaps. They may
be. At any rate FontForge will store them both in BDF fonts and in
OpenType Bitmap fonts. Each strike may have its own set of properties.
FontForge will generate them automatically when you create a strike (and
will retain them when it reads in a font that has them). You may
override the current values with the
[`Element-Bdf Info `](../../documentation/interface/elementmenu/#BDF-Info)dialog.

Creating a new bitmap only font
-------------------------------

If you want to create a new font with no outlines, only bitmap strikes,
you would use [File-\>New](../../documentation/interface/filemenu/#New) to create a new font, and
then `Element->Bitmap Strikes   Available` to add some (empty) strikes
to it. As soon as you add a strike to a new font, the font will become a
bitmap only font.

Apple has a bitmap only version of the sfnt file format, and X11 does
too. Of course the two formats are slightly different. Windows has no
support for a bitmap only sfnt format.

Bitmaps in the Font View
------------------------

The [`View`](../../documentation/interface/viewmenu/#bitmaps) menu of the Font View (and the
Metrics View) contains a list of all bitmap strikes in the font. You may
select which one will be displayed in the Font View. You may also change
the magnification at which a strike is displayed with [View-\>Bitmap
Magnification...](../../documentation/interface/viewmenu/#BitmapMag) (it can be hard to see the
details of an 8 pixel font on a high resolution screen, so you might
want to display it at 3 times its actual size).

Many commands in the Font View will apply to all strikes (and the
outline) in the font. For instance [`Edit->Copy`](../../documentation/interface/editmenu/#Copy)
will copy the outline glyph and all bitmap glyphs. Sometimes you only
want to affect one strike, if so then deselect
[`Edit->Copy From->All   Fonts`](../../documentation/interface/editmenu/#Fonts).

The [`Element->Build`](../../documentation/interface/elementmenu/#Accented)commands will build
accented bitmap glyphs just as it builds accented outline glyphs.

If the Font View is displaying a bitmap strike and you double click on a
character, then FontForge will bring up a [bitmap editing
window](../../documentation/interface/bitmapview/) displaying that character in the current strike
(rather than opening an outline editing window). If the character does
not have a matching glyph in the current strike FontForge will create
one by rasterizing the outline version of the font.

Editing Bitmaps
---------------

![](img/BitmapView.png)The bitmap editing window should be fairly self
explanatory. The window is a simple bitmap editor. With the pencil tool,
clicking on a pixel will make it change. The line tool will draw a
straight line between the start and end points.

You can see the outline glyph in the background of the bitmap.

You can regenerate the bitmap (by rasterizing the outline) by pressing
the `[Recalculate Bitmaps] `button.

Editing an anti-aliased greymap has the added complexity that you need
to select a color (actually a level of greyness) to be applied with the
pencil. There will be an additional palette with all possible greys for
this.

Sparse Bitmap Strikes
---------------------

Sometimes you don't need a complete set of bitmap glyphs in a strike.
Perhaps the rasterizer does a good job for all glyphs except one. Then
you can create an empty strike (with
`Element->Bitmap Strikes   Available` unchecking the
`[*] Create Rasterized Strikes` checkbox) and then select the one glyph
you care about and say
[`Element->Regenerate Bitmap   Glyphs`](../../documentation/interface/elementmenu/#Regenerate).

Alternately you could create a fully rasterized strike and then select
the glyphs you don't need and say `Element->Remove Bitmap   Glyphs`.
