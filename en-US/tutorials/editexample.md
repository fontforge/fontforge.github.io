tutorial, [this bundle](tutorial.tgz) should provide you with the basic

 I shall not presume to teach aesthetics, I concentrate solely on the

Font creation
-------------

First create a new font with the `New` command in the `File` menu (or by
using the -new argument at startup).

![](img/newfont.png)

Give the font a name with the `Font   Info` command from the `Element`
menu. You use this same command to set the copyright message and change
the ascent and descent (the sum of these two determines the size of the
em square for the font, and by convention is 1000 for postscript fonts,
a power of two (often 2048 or 4096) for truetype fonts and 15,000 for
Ikarus fonts). (Also if you are planning on making a truetype font you
might want to check the Quadratic Splines checkbox to use the native
truetype format. Editing is a little more difficult in this mode though)

![](img/fontinfo.png)

You may also wish to use Encoding-\>Reencode to change what characters
are available in your font. FontForge generally creates new fonts with
an ISO-8859-1, which contains (most of) the characters needed for
Western Europe (the latin letters, some accented letters, digits, and
symbols).

Creating a glyph
----------------

Once you have done that you are ready to start editing glyphs. Double
click on the entry for "C" in the font view above. You should now have
an empty Outline Glyph window:

![](img/C1.png)

The outline glyph window contains two palettes snuggled up on the left
side of the window. The top palette contains a set of editing tools, and
the bottom palette is for managing drawing layers. They can be added,
deleted (not all!), shown or hidden, for example.

Cubic layers (C) use third-order Bezier splines, like PS fonts.
Quadratic ones (Q) use second-degree splines, that are harder to edit,
but mathematically easier and simpler to control, so they are used in
TTF fonts.

The foreground (F) layer contains the outline that will become part of
the font. The background (B) layer can contain images or line drawings
that help you draw this particular glyph. The guide (\#) layer contains
lines that are useful on a font-wide basis (such as the x-height).
Currently all layers are empty.

This window also shows the glyph's internal coordinate system with the x
and y axes drawn in light grey. A line representing the glyph's advance
width is drawn in black at the right edge of the window. FontForge
assigns an advance width of one em (in PostScript that will usually be
1000 units) to the advance width of a new glyph.

Let us assume you already have a bitmap image of the glyph you are
working on. Select the Import command from the File menu and import that
image. It will be scaled so that it is as high as the em-square.

![](img/C2.png)

Select the background layer as editable from the layers palette, move
the mouse pointer to one of the edges of the image, hold down the shift
key, depress and drag the corner until the image is a reasonable size,
then move the pointer onto the dark part of the image, depress the mouse
and drag until the image is properly positioned.

![](img/C3.png)

If you have downloaded the [autotrace
program](http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/) you can invoke
`Element->AutoTrace` to generate an outline from the image. But if you
have not you must add points yourself. Change the active layer to be the
foreground, and go to the tools palette and select the round (or curve)
point. Then move the pointer to the edge of the image and add a point. I
find that it is best to add points at places where the curve is
horizontal or vertical, at corners, or where the curve changes
inflection (A change of inflection occurs in a curve like "S" where the
curve changes from being open to the left to being open on the right. If
you follow these rules hinting will work better.

![](img/C4.png)

It is best to enter a curve in a clockwise fashion, so the next point
should be added up at the top of the image on the flat section. Because
the shape becomes flat here, a curve point is not appropriate, rather a
tangent point is (this looks like a little triangle on the tools
palette). A tangent point makes a nice transition from curves to
straight lines because the curve leaves the point with the same slope
the line had when it entered.

![](img/C5.png)

At the moment this "curve" doesn't match the image at all, don't worry
about that we'll fix it later, and anyway it will change on its own as
we continue. Note that we now have a control point attached to the
tangent point (the little blue x). The next point needs to go where the
image changes direction abruptly. Neither a curve nor a tangent point is
appropriate here, instead we must use a corner point (one of the little
squares on the tools palette).

![](img/C6.png)

As you see the old curve now follows the image a bit more closely. We
continue adding points until we are ready to close the path.

![](img/C7.png)

Then we close the path just by adding a new point on top of the old
start point

![](img/C8.png)

Now we must make the curve track the image more closely, to do this we
must adjust the control points (the blue "x"es). To make all the control
points visible select the pointer tool and double-click on the curve and
then move the control points around until the curve looks right.

![](img/C9.png)

Finally we set width. Again with the pointer tool, move the mouse to the
width line on the right edge of the screen, depress and drag the line
back to a reasonable location.

![](img/C10.png)

And we are done with this glyph.

If you are mathematically inclined you may be interested in the
coordinates that fontforge shows in the upper left of the window.
Generally you can draw glyphs quite happily without bothering about
these, but for those who are interested here is some basic info:

-   Each glyph has its own coordinate system.
-   The vertical origin is the font's baseline (the line on which most
    latin letters rest)
-   The horizontal origin is the place where drawing the glyph will
    commence. In the example above what gets drawn initially is empty
    space, that is fairly common, and that empty space (the distance
    from the origin to the left edge of the glyph) is called the left
    side bearing.
-   The units of the coordinate system are determined by the em-size of
    the font. This is the sum of the font's ascent and descent. In the
    example above the font's ascent is 800 and descent is 200, and the
    ascent line (the one just above the top of the "C") is 800 units
    from the baseline, while the descent line is 200 units below.
-   So a position of 282,408 (as above) means that the cursor is 282
    units right of the horizontal origin and 408 units above the
    baseline (or roughly halfway between baseline and ascent).
