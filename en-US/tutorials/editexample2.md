Navigating to glyphs.
---------------------

The font view provides one way of navigating around the glyphs in a
font. Simple scroll around it until you find the glyph you need and then
double click on it to open a window looking at that glyph.

Typing a glyph will move to that glyph.

However some fonts are huge (Chinese, Japanese and Korean fonts have
thousands or even tens of thousands of glyphs) and scrolling around the
font view is a an inefficient way of finding your glyph.
`View->Goto `provides a simple dialog which will allow you to move
directly to any glyph for which you know the name (or encoding). If your
font is a Unicode font, then this dialog will also allow you to find
glyphs by block name (ie. Hebrew rather than Alef).

The simplest way to navigate is just to go to the next or previous
glyph. And `View->Next Char` and `View->Prev Char` will do exactly that.

Creating the letter "o" -- consistent directions
------------------------------------------------

In the previous example the bitmap of the letter filled the canvas of
the image. And when FontForge imported the image it needed to be scaled
once in the program. But usually when you create the image of the letter
you have some idea of how much white space there should be around it. If
your images are exactly one em high then FontForge will scale them
automatically to be the right size. So in the following examples all the
images have exactly the right amount of white-space around them to fit
perfectly in an em.

For the next example double click on the square in the font view that
should contain "o", and import "o\_Ambrosia.png" into it.

  :  Stages in editing "o"

Notice that the first outline is drawn clockwise and the second
counter-clockwise. This change in drawing direction is important. Both
PostScript and TrueType require that the outer boundary of a glyph be
drawn in a certain direction (they happen to be opposite from each
other, which is a mild annoyance), within FontForge all outer boundaries
must be drawn clockwise, while all inner boundaries must be drawn
counter-clockwise.

If you fail to alternate directions between outer and inner boundaries
you may get results like the one on the left ![](img/o-baddir.png). If you
fail to draw the outer contour in a clockwise fashion the errors are
more subtle, but will generally result in a less pleasing result once
the glyph has been rasterized.

**TECHNICAL AND CONFUSING**: the exact behavior of rasterizers varies.
Early PostScript rasterizers used a "non-zero winding number rule" while
more recent ones use an "even-odd" rule. TrueType uses the "non-zero"
rule. The description given above is for the "non-zero" rule. The
"even-odd" rule would fill the "o" correctly no matter which way the
paths were drawn (though there would probably be subtle problems with
hinting).

Filling using the even-odd rules that a line is drawn from the current
pixel to infinity (in any direction) and the number of contour crossings
is counted. If this number is even the pixel is not filled. If the
number is odd the pixel is filled. In the non-zero winding number rule
the same line is drawn, contour crossings in a clockwise direction add 1
to the crossing count, counter-clockwise contours subtract 1. If the
result is 0 the pixel is not filled, any other result will fill it.

The command `Element->Correct   Direction` will look at each selected
contour, figure out whether it qualifies as an outer or inner contour
and will reverse the drawing direction when the contour is drawn
incorrectly.
