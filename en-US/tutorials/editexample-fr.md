Font creation
-------------

First create a new font with the `New` command in the `File` menu (or by
using the -new argument at startup).

![](img/newfont.png)

Give the font a name with the `Font Info` command from the `Element`
menu. You use this same command to change the encoding (ie what
characters are available in the font), set the copyright message and
change the ascent and descent (the sum of these two determines the size
of the em square for the font, and by convention is 1000 for postscript
fonts, a power of two (often 2048 or 4096) for truetype fonts and 15,000
for Ikarus fonts).

Creating a character
--------------------

Once you have done that you are ready to start editing characters.
Double click on the entry for "C" in the font view above. You should now
have an empty Outline Character window:

![](img/C1.png)

Select the Import command from the File menu and import an image of the
character you are creating. It will be scaled so that it is as high as
the em-square.

![](img/C2.png)

Select the background layer as editable from the layers palette, move
the mouse pointer to one of the edges of the image, hold down the shift
key, depress and drag the corner until the image is a reasonable size,
then move the pointer onto the dark part of the image, depress the mouse
and drag until the image is properly positioned.

![](img/C3.png)

If you have downloaded the [autotrace
program](http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/) you can invoke
`Element->AutoTrace` to generate an outline from the image. But if you
have not you must add points yourself. Change the active layer to be the
foreground, and go to the tools palette and select the round (or curve)
point. Then move the pointer to the edge of the image and add a point. I
find that it is best to add points at places where the curve is
horizontal or vertical, at corners, or where the curve changes
inflection (A change of inflection occurs in a curve like "S" where the
curve changes from being open to the left to being open on the right. If
you follow these rules hinting will work better.

![](img/C4.png)

It is best to enter a curve in a clockwise fashion, so the next point
should be added up at the top of the image on the flat section. Because
the shape becomes flat here, a curve point is not appropriate, rather a
tangent point is (this looks like a little triangle on the tools
palette). A tangent point makes a nice transition from curves to
straight lines because the curve leaves the point with the same slope
the line had when it entered.

![](img/C5.png)

At the moment this "curve" doesn't match the image at all, don't worry
about that we'll fix it later, and anyway it will change on its own as
we continue. Note that we now have a control point attached to the
tangent point (the little blue x). The next point needs to go where the
image changes direction abruptly. Neither a curve nor a tangent point is
appropriate here, instead we must use a corner point (one of the little
squares on the tools palette).

![](img/C6.png)

As you see the old curve now follows the image a bit more closely. We
continue adding points until we are ready to close the path.

![](img/C7.png)

Then we close the path just by adding a new point on top of the old
start point

![](img/C8.png)

Now we must make the curve track the image more closely, to do this we
must adjust the control points (the blue "x"es). To make all the control
points visible select the pointer tool and double-click on the curve and
then move the control points around until the curve looks right.

![](img/C9.png)

Finally we set width. Again with the pointer tool, move the mouse to the
width line on the right edge of the screen, depress and drag the line
back to a reasonable location.

![](img/C10.png)

And we are done with this character.

Well sort of. If you are like me you didn't get everything quite right
even though you checked. You can use Element-\>[Find
Problems](../../documentation/interface/problems/)... to check for simple mistakes (like having
your vertical lines be slightly skewed).

You can use `View->Next Char` and `View->Prev Char` to look at
additional characters.

Most modern fonts will contain accented characters. Accented characters
are easy to make once you have made the accents and base characters they
depend on. For example if you have created the "C" character and the
"cedilla" then you can scroll the font view until you can see the
"Ccedilla" character, then select it and use Element-\>[Build Accented
Char](../../documentation/interface/accented/) to create the accented glyph.

Of course you can also do this manually. Another way is to select the
"C" character and do Edit-\>Copy Reference, then select the "Ccedilla"
character and Edit-\>Paste, select the "cedilla" character and
Edit-\>Copy Reference, select the "Ccedilla" character again, and open
it up by double clicking on it, and then doing Edit-\>Paste. You will
probably have to adjust the cedilla until it snuggles properly under the
C.

When you have created all your accents you have created your first font.

One of the hardest tasks of all is getting to spaces around the
characters to look nice. FontForge has a `Metrics->Auto Width` command
which attempts to guess reasonable values for the character spacings in
your font. Just select the "All" radio button in both sets of buttons
and press OK.

At this point you might want some bitmaps to go with the postscript
(this is not compulsory). Go to `Element->Bitmaps Available` and select
the pixel sizes you want bitmaps in (Note, that on X and MS windows
pixel sizes often do not correspond exactly to point sizes. You can then
use the bitmap editor (`File->Open Bitmap`) to clean up the bitmaps, or
you can generate your bitmap fonts and then [use someone else's bitmap
editor to clean them up](http://clr.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/download.html).

![](img/BitmapView.png)

Last of all you can generate font files. Select `File->Generate Fonts`,
select the outline font format, and which (if any) of your bitmaps you
want converted into a bitmap font.
