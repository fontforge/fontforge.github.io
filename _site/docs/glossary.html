<dt id="term-abjad">Abjad</dt><dd><p>Abjad is the technical term for the type of writing system used by Semitic
languages (Hebrew, Arabic, etc.), where there are glyphs for all the
consonants but the reader must be prepared to guess what vowel to add between
two consonants.</p>
<p>Both Hebrew and Arabic have optional vowel marks and are called “impure”
abjads. Ancient Phoenician had nothing but consonants and is a “pure” abjad.</p>

<dt id="term-abugida">Abugida</dt><dd><p>An abugida is somewhere in between an <a class="reference internal" href="#term-alphabet"><span class="xref std std-term">alphabet</span></a> and
a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-syllabary"><span class="xref std std-term">syllabary</span></a>. The Indic writing systems are
probably the best known abugidas.</p>
<p>In most abugidas there are independant glyphs for the consonants, and each
consonant is implicitly followed by a default vowel sound. All vowels other
than the default will be marked by either diacritics or some other
modification to the base consonant.</p>
<p>An abugida differs from a syllabary in that there is a common theme to the
the images representing a syllable beginning with a given consonant (that is,
the glyph for the consonant), while in a syllabary each syllable is distinct
even if two start with a common consonant.</p>
<p>An abugida differs from an abjad in that vowels (other than the default) must
be marked in the abugida.</p>

encodings).</p>

renaissance printing the letter “s” had two glyphs associated with it, one,

<p>In order for the curved shape of the “O” to appear to be the same height as
the flat top of the “I” it tends to “overshoot” the cap-height (or x-height),
or undershoot the baseline by about 3% of the cap-height (or x-height). For a
triangular shape (such as “A”) the overshoot is even greater, perhaps 5%.</p>
<p>These guidelines are based on the way the eye works and the optical illusions
it generates and are taken from Peter Karow’s <em>Digital Formats for
Typefaces</em>, p. 26).</p>
<p>The overshoot is also dependant on the point-size of a font, the larger the
point-size the smaller the overshoot should be. Generally modern fonts will
be used at multiple point-sizes, but in some font families there are multiple
faces for the different point-sizes, and in such a case the overshoot will
probably vary from face to face.</p>

changing the left-side-bearing or the advance width. Early versions of

<p>In Renaissance typography, before there were points, sizes of type had names,
and “pica” was used in this context. As: “Great Canon”, “Double Pica”, “Great
Primer”, “English”, “Pica”, “Primer”, “Small Pica”, “Brevier”, “Nonpareil”

</dd>
<dt id="term-point">Point</dt><dd><p>A point is a unit of measurement. There were three (at least) different
definitions for “point” in common usage before the advent of computers. The
one in use in the Anglo-Saxon printing world was the “pica point” with 72.27
points per inch ( 2.85pt /mm ), while the one used in continental Europe was
the didot point with 62 <sup>2</sup>/<span class="small">3</span> points per 23.566mm ( 2.66pt/mm
or 67.54pt/inch ) and the French sometimes used the Mediaan point (72.78
points per inch, 2.86pt/mm).</p>
<p>The didiot and pica points were so arranged that text at a given point-size
would have approximately the same <a class="reference internal" href="#term-cap-height"><span class="xref std std-term">cap-height</span></a> in
both systems, the didot point would have extra white-space above the capitals
to contain the accents present in most non-English Latin based scripts.</p>
<p>This has the interesting side effect that a font designed for European usage
should have a smaller proportion of the vertical em given over to the text
body. I believe that computer fonts tend to ignore this, so presumably
european printers now set with more leading.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, computers tend to work in approximations to pica points
(but this may be because I am in the US), PostScript uses a unit of 1/72nd of
an inch.</p>
<p>Originally fonts were not described by point size, but by
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-pica"><span class="xref std std-term">name</span></a>. It was not until the 1730s that
Pierre Fournier that created the point system for specifying font heights.
This was later improved upon by François Didiot (whence the name of the
point). In 1878 the Chicago Type Foundry first used a point system in the US.
In 1886 the US point was standardized – the pica was defined to be 35/83cm,
and the pica point defined to be 1/12th of that.</p>

<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#overview-pt"><span class="std std-ref">PostScript differs from TrueType</span></a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Type 1 – This is the old standard for PostScript fonts. Such a font
generally has the extension .pfb (or .pfa). A type 1 font is limited to a one
byte encoding (ie. only 256 glyphs may be encoded).</p></li>
<li><p>Type 2/CFF – This is the format used within
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-opentype"><span class="xref std std-term">OpenType</span></a> fonts. It is almost the same as Type 1,
but has a few extensions and a more compact format. It is usually inside a
CFF wrapper, which is usually inside an OpenType font. The CFF font format
again only allows a 1 byte encoding, but the OpenType wrapper extends this to
provide more complex encoding types.</p></li>
<li><p>Type 3 – This format allows full postscript within the font, but it means
that no <a class="reference internal" href="#term-hints"><span class="xref std std-term">hints</span></a> are allowed, so these fonts will not
look as nice at small point-sizes. Also most (screen) rasterizers are
incapable of dealing with them. A type 3 font is limited to a one byte
encoding (ie. only 256 glyphs may be encoded).</p></li>
<li><p>Type 0 – This format is used for collecting many sub-fonts (of Type 1, 2 or
3) into one big font with a multi-byte encoding, and was used for CJK or
Unicode fonts.</p></li>
<li><p>Type 42 – A <a class="reference internal" href="#term-true-type"><span class="xref std std-term">TrueType</span></a> font wrapped up in
PostScript. Sort of the opposite from OpenType.</p></li>
<li><p>CID – This format is used for CJK fonts with large numbers of glyphs. The
glyphs themselves are specified either as type1 or type2 glyph format. The
CID font itself has no encoding, just a mapping from CID (a number) to glyph.

<p>Back two thousand years ago when the Romans were carving their letters on
stone monuments, they discovered that they could reduce the chance of the
stone cracking by adding fine lines at the terminations of the main stems of
a glyph.</p>
<p>These fine lines were called serifs, and came to have an esthetic appeal of
their own. Early type designers added them to their fonts for esthetic rather
than functional reasons.</p>
<p>At the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries,
type-designers started designing fonts without serifs. These were initially
called grotesques because their form appeared so strange, they are now
generally called sans-serif.</p>
<p>Other writing systems (Hebrew for one) have their own serifs. Hebrew serifs
are rather different from latin (cyrillic, greek) serifs and I don’t know
their history. Hebrew serifs only occur at the top of a glyph</p>
<p>I would welcome examples from other scripts of serifed and sans-serifed
glyphs.</p>

sub-fonts, each with a 1 byte encoding which TeX (or older versions of TeX)
needed.</p></li>

<p>The “state machine” consists of a table of states, each state in turn
consists of a series of potential transitions (to the same or different
states) depending on the input. In state machines within fonts, the machine
starts out in a special state called the start state, and reads the glyph
stream of the text. Each individual glyph will cause a state transition to
occur. As these transitions occur the machine may also specify changes to the
glyph stream (conditional substitutions or kerning).</p>
