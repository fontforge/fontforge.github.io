<h1>Font View<a class="headerlink" href="#font-view" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<img alt="../../_images/AmbrosiaFV.png" src="../../_images/AmbrosiaFV.png" />
<p>The font view is a list of all the glyphs available in the given font.</p>
<p>You may chose to display it at various sizes, by default it will be displayed
with the outline font rasterized on a 24 pixel em square. You may display it at
36, 48, 72 and 96 pixel sizes as well. You may also choose to look at an
anti-aliased greymap (the above image is anti-aliased). These are slower to
generate but look nicer (<a class="reference internal" href="../../techref/AA-Comparison.html"><span class="doc">Comparison</span></a>).</p>
<p>If you have an encoding slot which has nothing in it (as opposed to an encoding
which maps to a space glyph) then that will be shown by a faint red X drawn
across the box.</p>
<p>Above each image of the glyphs in the font is a label indicating the glyph in
some conventional format. Usually this is just a small image of the glyph in a
standard font (as it is above), but you can change it to show the glyph’s name,
unicode code point or encoding (in hex). In small views (24 pixel view for
instance) there may not be room for the entire label, and it will appear
truncated.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/fvOutOfDateHinting.png" class="align-left" src="../../_images/fvOutOfDateHinting.png" />
<p>If a glyph has been changed since it was last hinted (PostScript), or if a glyph
contains contours but has no instructions (TrueType), then its label will be
edged with blue bars. If the glyph has out of date instructions (TrueType), then
its label will be edged with red.</p>
<p>If one of your glyphs has something in its background layer then this will be
indicated visually (currently by darkening the background of the glyph label).</p>
<p>Normally the view will display the foreground layer of the font, but you may
change it to display any layer (other than the background layer) with
<a class="reference internal" href="../menus/viewmenu.html#viewmenu-fvlayers"><span class="std std-ref">View-&gt;Layers-&gt;?</span></a></p>
<p>You may also display any of the bitmap fonts you have generated from the outline
glyphs. Simply go to the View menu and select the one you want.</p>
<p>If you look at a bitmap version of the font, and it does not contain a glyph for
which there is an outline glyph (ie. the font needs its bitmaps regenerated)
then the missing glyph will be outlined in red to bring it to your attention
more easily.</p>
<p>Small bitmap fonts will be magnified. If the pixelsize of the font is less than
10 it will be shown 3 times normal size, if less than 20 twice normal size.</p>
<p>Underneath the menu bar is some information on the last glyph selected. First is
the encoding of the glyph in the current font expressed in decimal. Next is the
unicode code point for the glyph (or ???? if it is not a unicode character).
Next the postscript name for the glyph, and finally the unicode name. Not all
unicode characters will have unicode names (the CJK characters do not for
example)</p>
<p>If you move the cursor to a glyph and let it rest there a small popup window
will appear containing information about that glyph. If you depress the control
key then this window is locked in place until you move the mouse.</p>
<p id="fontview-metrics">You may display metrics lines (baseline, origin and advance width) in the font
view. (View -&gt; Show H Metrics). If you do so, I suggest viewing the font at a
large pixel size, otherwise the window looks too confusing.</p>
<div class="flex-container">
<div class="flex-row">
<div class="flex-col">
<img alt="../../_images/FVHMetrics.png" src="../../_images/FVHMetrics.png" />
<p>A 96 pixel display showing the various horizontal metric lines.</p>
<p>The blue line is the baseline</p>
<p>The small red tick on the left marks the glyph origin.</p>
<p>The green line on the right shows where the advance width is while the bottom
green line shows how long it is. (normally you will not display both at once)</p>
<p>The glyph is centered horizontally, and the font ascent is the top of the box
displaying it, while the descent is the bottom.</p>
</div>
<div class="flex-col">
<img alt="../../_images/FVVMetrics.png" src="../../_images/FVVMetrics.png" />
<p>A 96 pixel display showing the various vertical metric lines.</p>
<p>The blue line down the center is the vertical baseline.</p>
<p>The red bar at the top (over writing the ascent line) is the vertical origin.</p>
<p>The green line at the bottom shows where the vertical advance is while the
green line on the right shows how long it is. (normally you will not display
both at once)</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You may select any number of glyphs in the font by dragging through them. You
may use shift-click to select (or deselect) additional glyphs. You may also use
the arrow keys to move around (and shift-arrow to select). To some extent the
order you select glyphs in will be remembered and a few commands will make use
of that.</p>
<p>You may drag and drop selected glyphs into</p>
<dl class="object">
<dt>
<code class="sig-name descname">The metrics view</code></dt>
<dd><p>Where they will be inserted into the display before the selected glyph
(selected in the metrics view) in the order in which you selected them in the
font view.</p>
</dd></dl>

<dl class="object">
<dt>
<code class="sig-name descname">The outline view</code></dt>
<dd><p>Where they will appear as references</p>
</dd></dl>

<dl class="object">
<dt>
<code class="sig-name descname">The glyph info substitutions/ligature dlg</code></dt>
<dd><p>Where they will appear as a substitution or ligature.</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>The [Tab] key will move to the next glyph with something in it, and Shift-[Tab]
will move to the previous glyph with something interesting.</p>
<p>You can perform various operations on the selected glyphs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Apply a general transformation (ie. move 20 units right and then rotate 180°)</p></li>
<li><p>Expand all paths to be stroked paths</p></li>
<li><p>Clean up areas where several paths intersect</p></li>
<li><p>Simplify paths</p></li>
<li><p>Build Accented Characters</p></li>
<li><p>Regenerate bitmaps</p></li>
<li><p>Autohint</p></li>
<li><p>Control various metrics settings</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, you can cut and paste. Normally copying a glyph will copy that
glyph and any bitmaps associated with it, but you can use the Edit-&gt;Copy From
menu item to change this so that only entries from the currently displayed font
are copied. So if a 12 pixel font is being displayed then only the bitmaps from
the 12 pixel bitmap font will be copied in this mode. Cut and Clear will clear
those things which would be copied.</p>
<p>Paste is a little more complicated. In general it will paste whatever is in the
clipboard, regardless of the copy mode. So if the clipboard contains a 12pixel
bitmap and the font view is displaying outlines, then pasting it will paste it
into the 12pixel font none the less. There is one exception to this. If the
clipboard contains a 12 pixel bitmap and the font view is currently display a
17pixel bitmap then the paste will go into the displayed bitmap.</p>
<p>A Paste from the font view will delete whatever splines were in the glyph
beforehand (while a paste in the outline glyph view will merge the new set of
splines with the old). Paste from the font view will also set the width of the
glyph.</p>
<p>You can scroll the display to any particular character by typing that character.
There is also a dialog which allows a slightly more general way of jumping
around. You may type in the glyph’s name (all glyphs in a font will be named),
its encoding value, its unicode encoding value, or (for 2 byte fonts) its ku ten
specification.</p>
<p>Pressing the right mouse button invokes a popup menu.</p>
<div class="section" id="encodings-and-character-sets">
<span id="fontview-encodings"></span><h2>Encodings and Character Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#encodings-and-character-sets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A Character Set is a set of characters (for example all the letters of the
alphabet would be one character set). An encoding is a function that takes a
number (often between 0 and 255) and maps it to a character. Often these two are
used synonymously as an encoding generally implies a given character set.
(strictly speaking a character set is an unordered collection with no implied
encoding, and some encodings work with multiple character sets).</p>
<p>All fonts in fontforge have both a character set and an encoding. The character
set is just the set of characters in the font. The encoding is the way those
characters are ordered (or sometimes, the way the first 256 are ordered). The
font info dialog allows you to chose the encoding (and character set) you wish
for a font. Often a font will have a few extra glyphs that don’t fit into the
character set specified by the encoding, these glyphs will be placed at the end
of the font and when the font is output (ie. postscript is generated, or a
bitmap font created) the glyphs will be included in the font but they will not
be encoded (this can be useful, especially in postscript where it is possible to
reencode a font at run time. Thus a font might have all the glyphs needed both
for a cyrillic character set and for a latin one, but only one character set at
a time would be encoded).</p>
<p>It is possible for an encoding not to be one-to-one. That is there may be
several characters that might lead to the same underlying glyph (the classic
example is the non-breaking space which often uses the same glyph as the
breaking space). When FontForge encounters such an encoding it will create a
character structure for each entry, one of those structures will contain the
data for drawing the glyph, the other(s) will contain a reference to the one
real character. All characters will have the same name. When FontForge generates
a font it looks for this case and turns it into a font whose encoding vector
contains multiple references to a glyph.</p>
<p>It is also possible to have an encoding where a single character can lead to
several different glyphs depending on the context. In arabic, for example, most
characters have at least four different glyphs depending on whether the
character is found initially, medially or finally in a word, or if it appears by
itself (isolated).</p>
<p>You may also create a custom encoding. (Generally, only the first 256 entries of
a Custom encodings will actually be part of a font’s encoding vector). You may
change the name of any glyph in the font with the Element-&gt;Char Info command.
This will force the font to have a custom encoding.</p>
<p>There are many standard encodings built in to the program. There are 14 ISO 8859
encodings, the encoding used by the Macintosh for the US and Western Europe, the
encoding used by MS Windows for the US and Europe (which is a slight extension
of ISO 8859-1). There are also several 2-byte encodings built in. Several of
these are subsets of unicode (whose goal is to specify every character currently
used by humans). There are many large CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) two byte
encodings. You can also add your own encodings with the
<a class="reference internal" href="../menus/encodingmenu.html"><span class="doc">Encoding</span></a> menu. A brief description of what’s in the
encodings also appears <a class="reference internal" href="../menus/encodingmenu.html"><span class="doc">on that page</span></a>.</p>
<p>There may be some slight differences between one vendor’s definition of an
encoding and another. I try to follow those encodings specified by the Unicode
consortium. I notice that the Symbol encoding used by Microsoft differs from the
Unicode one (usually just be substituting synonyms, Omega for Ohm sign for
instance).</p>
<p>Adobe did not choose their naming conventions very well for Greek letters. They
assigned the name “mu” to Micro Sign, “Delta” to Increment and “Omega” to Ohm
Sign. So the Greek alphabet has ugly nameless holes in it.</p>
<p>CID fonts (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fontview-cid"><span class="std std-ref">below</span></a>) have no encodings. Instead they are
designed to be associated with one or several cmap files which provide encodings
in a general way. cmap files are beyond the scope of FontForge. Adobe has
defined many which are freely
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/acrrasianfontpack.html">available</a>.</p>
<p>There is one final encoding called “Glyph Order”. This encoding is just the
glyphs in the order in which they were read from the original font.</p>
<div class="section" id="unicode-iso-10646">
<span id="fontview-unicode"></span><h3>Unicode (ISO 10646)<a class="headerlink" href="#unicode-iso-10646" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>PostScript® assigns a name to every unicode character. Some of these names are
fairly obvious like “A” for the first letter of the latin alphabet, others are
more obscure like “afii57664” for hebrew alef, while others are just “uni8765”
for the unicode character at 0x8765.</p>
<p>PostScript Unicode encoding does not quite mesh with the unicode standard. This
is probably because PostScript deals in glyphs and Unicode deals with characters
so PostScript sees no distinction between space and nobreak space (and so does
not encode the latter) while Unicode does.</p>
<p>According to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unicode.org/">unicode website</a> the first 256
character positions of unicode and ISO 8859-1 (ISO Latin1) are the same. However
the PostScript encoding of ISOLatin1 is slightly different from that specified
for unicode. I cannot explain the reasoning behind this. FontForge does not use
PostScript’s ISOLatin1 Encoding vector, instead it uses the first 256 code
positions of the unicode encoding vector (slightly modified by me to conform to
Unicode conventions rather than PostScript. So I include nobreak space and the
soft-hyphen).</p>
<p>FontForge supports two slightly different unicode encodings. The first contains
only the first 65536 characters of unicode (those in the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/bmp.html">Basic Multilingual Plane</a>, or
BMP), while the second can contain as many characters as you have memory for.
Character definitions are still sparse outside of the BMP so at the moment you
probably want to use just the BMP. Currently there are only definitions for
plane 0 (BMP, U+0000-U+ffff), Plane 1
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp.html">SMP, Secondary Multilingual Plane</a>,
U+10000-U+1ffff), Plane 2
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/sip.html">SIP, Supplementary Ideographic Plane</a>,
U+20000-U+2ffff), and Plane 14
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/ssp.html">SSP Supplementary Special-purpose Plane</a>,
U+e0000-U+effff).</p>

<div class="section" id="cid-keyed-fonts">
<span id="fontview-cid"></span><h2>CID keyed fonts<a class="headerlink" href="#cid-keyed-fonts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The standard mechanisms that postscript provides work reasonably well for
alphabets and syllabaries, but the massive number of characters needed for CJK
(Chinese, Japanese or Korean) fonts require more complex machinations. Adobe’s
current solution is the <a class="reference internal" href="../menus/cidmenu.html#cidmenu-cid"><span class="std std-ref">CID-keyed font</span></a>, a font consisting
of several subfonts each a collection of glyph descriptions with no encoding
imposed on them and no names given to them.</p>
<p>If FontForge loads in a CID keyed font it will enable a special menu called
<a class="reference internal" href="../menus/cidmenu.html"><span class="doc">CID</span></a> which (among other things) displays the list of all the
sub-fonts in the font. When it starts up FontForge will pick (practically at
random) a sub-font to display in the font view. You may change which font is
displayed by the CID menu.</p>
<p>The CID menu also allows you to turn a normal font into a CID keyed font. It
creates a collection containing just the original font (you may add other fonts,
or blank fonts, later). But before it can create a collection FontForge needs to
know what glyph set you will be using. A glyph set is just a collection of
glyphs, and you may define your own if you wish (but if you do you have to
define your own cmap files, etc and it’s probably not worth it). Adobe has
defined glyph sets for Japanese (actually there are two, one corresponding to
JIS208 and one to JIS212), Korean (Wansung &amp; Johab), Traditional Chinese (Big5)
and Simplified Chinese (GB2312). Although these glyph sets are based on the
standards mentioned, they each have many additional glyphs. Adobe also defines a
glyph set that works for Unicode, but it is called “Identity” instead. FontForge
does not have these glyph sets built in to it, each must be loaded the first
time it is used. I provide one file for each of the above glyph sets, they have
an extension of “.cidmap”, and you may download them all
<a class="reference external" href="https://fontforge.org/downloads/cidmaps.tgz">from here</a>.</p>
<p>(There are also many other character sets floating around feel free to install
them yourself).</p>
<p>Adobe identifies each glyph set by a three values: a registry, an ordering and a
supplement. The registry is the name of the organization that is defining the
glyph set (Adobe calls itself Adobe), an ordering identifies the glyph set
(Japan1, Korea1, etc.) and the supplement indicates how many times the ordering
has been revised. Glyphs may only be added to an ordering, never removed, so an
old font will be perfectly described by a newer glyph set, while a new font
described by an old glyph set will have some unavailable glyphs. So a full
cidmap name will look like:</p>
<p>Adobe-Japan1-4.cidmap</p>
<p>Adobe-Korea1-2.cidmap</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>FontForge’s support for CID-keyed fonts is rudimentary; especially attempting
to use Compact encodings and the Metrics View in CID-keyed fonts is known to
cause issues and crashes. At one time, the memory usage of CID-keyed fonts
was seen as very worrisome (≈250MB), however as even most modern smartphones
can support such usage it is no longer a concern for the majority of users.
Therefore, we recommend that if you will make serious edits to a CID-keyed
font, you <a class="reference internal" href="../menus/cidmenu.html#cidmenu-cid"><span class="std std-ref">flatten</span></a> it first to prevent crashes and memory
corruption. Bug fixes are always welcome-to start, see
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/3946#issuecomment-534005675">issue №3946</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="../menus/editmenu.html#editmenu-remove-undoes"><span class="std std-ref">Remove Undoes</span></a> command will allow you to free
up memory if you think you may be running short. FontForge is not always able to
protect itself against running out of memory, sometimes the OS just sends it a
SIGKILL signal.</p>

<div class="section" id="multiple-master-fonts">
<span id="fontview-mm"></span><h2>Multiple Master Fonts<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-master-fonts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the font is a <a class="reference internal" href="../dialogs/multiplemaster.html#multiplemaster-mm"><span class="std std-ref">Multiple Master</span></a> Font there will
again be several subfonts only this time all the subfonts contain the same glyph
set. Each subfont provides glyphs for one style of the font family. The
<a class="reference internal" href="../menus/mmmenu.html"><span class="doc">MM</span></a> menu allows you to control which style of the family is
visible in the font view, and provides a few other commands for manipulating
multiple masters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vertical-metrics">
<span id="fontview-vertical-metrics"></span><h2>Vertical Metrics<a class="headerlink" href="#vertical-metrics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>CJK fonts generally should have vertical metrics. Latin (Cyrillic, Greek) fonts
generally should not. If FontForge reads in a font with vertical metrics it will
retain those metrics, but when FontForge creates a new font then that font will
not have vertical metrics enabled.</p>
<p>To enable vertical metrics for a font go to
<a class="reference internal" href="../dialogs/fontinfo.html#fontinfo-vertical"><span class="std std-ref">Element-&gt;Font Info</span></a> and select the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">General</span></code> tab and
check the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[*]</span> <span class="pre">Has</span> <span class="pre">Vertical</span> <span class="pre">Metrics</span></code> checkbox. This will allow you to set the
vertical origin for the font and it will give every glyph a default vertical
advance of the emsize of the font (ascent+descent).</p>
<p>The vertical origin is the y height (in the design coordinate system) of the
origin for vertical metrics.</p>
<p>In the outline glyph view you will be able to adjust the vertical metrics just
as you adjust the horizontal metrics.</p>
<p>You can view the vertical metrics in the font view just as you can the
horizontal metrics with View-&gt;Show V Metrics.</p>
