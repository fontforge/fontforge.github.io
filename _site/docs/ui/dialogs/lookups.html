</div></blockquote>
<p>You use the Lookups pane of the <a class="reference internal" href="fontinfo.html"><span class="doc">Element-&gt;Font Info</span></a> command to
control OpenType lookups.</p>
<p>A lookup is a collection of commands that provide a text layout program with a
transformation to apply on the input glyph stream. A lookup might specify how to
form ligatures or how to do kerning, or any of a number of other things.</p>
<p>Every lookup is composed of a number of subtables. Often this complexity is not
needed and many lookups will contain just one subtable.</p>
<p>Every lookup is named and every subtable is named. No two lookups may have the
same name, nor may any two subtables.</p>
<p>There are two major classes of lookups, those that reside in the GSUB table and
substitute one glyph (or several) with another (ligatures) and those which live
in the GPOS table and position one glyph relative to another (kerning).</p>
<p>The order in which the lookups and subtables appear in this dialog is important.
This is the same order in which they will be applied. All lookups in the GSUB
table will be applied before any lookups in the GPOS table.</p>
<p>There are buttons on the side for reordering the lookups. Up, Down, Top, Bottom
should be obvious. You can also drag and drop lookups to reorder them. The
[Sort] button will sort lookups depending on the cannonical order of the
features attached to them. This will not always be the desired ordering, but it
is a place to start.</p>
<p>Lookups are applied in the order listed here. Which lookups will be applied
depends on the script, language, and what features have been enabled (this will
be controlled by the text layout engine, and perhaps ultimately by the user).</p>
<p>Within a lookup, the subtables will be applied in order until one of them
actually does something. Then no further subtables will be executed. Note that
this is different from the way lookups behave – all active lookups will always
be applied, but only one subtable in a lookup will be.</p>
<p>Suppose for example that you have a kerning class, and a few kerning pairs. If
you put both of these into one lookup, with the kerning pairs in the first
subtable and the kerning class in the second, then if a kerning pair matches the
input stream the kerning class will not be applied (so you can have special
cases that override the data in the kerning class).</p>
<p>On the other hand if you put the pairs in one lookup, and the kerning class in
another lookup, then both would be applied. And the resultant motion would be
the sum of the two.</p>

allows you to control the attributes of the lookup. Every lookup has a lookup
type (here “Single Substitution”) which specifies broadly what kinds of things
this lookup can do.</p>

<p>A lookup may be associated with one or more feature tags each of which may be
active for various scripts and languages. You may edit the feature tag directly,
or you may click on the little box and get a list of feature tags identified by
their “friendly names” (so instead of ‘smcp’ you would see “Lowercase to Small
Capitals”).</p>
<p>Similarly you may edit the script and language list directly, or you may press
on the rectangle to get a friendlier dialog (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#lookups-scripts-dlg"><span class="std std-ref">below</span></a>).</p>
<p>Every lookup is associated with a set of flags which control its behavior. The
“Mark Class:” field is only active if there are
<a class="reference internal" href="fontinfo.html#fontinfo-markclass-marksets"><span class="std std-ref">Mark Classes</span></a> defined, and the “Mark Set:” field is
active if there are <a class="reference internal" href="fontinfo.html#fontinfo-markclass-marksets"><span class="std std-ref">Mark Sets</span></a> defined. Mark classes
and sets are very similar, with mark sets being the newer (largely unsupported
as I write in spring 2009) but more versatile of the two. These provide an
extension of the Ignore Marks flag – if you specify a mark class (or set) then
all marks will be ignored except those in the class (or set).</p>
<p>Every lookup must be named. You may assign the name as you wish – except that
it must not be blank and must be unique. No two lookups may have the same name.
(If you intend to use feature files, then lookup names should be: less than 31
characters, composed of ASCII alphanumerics, underscores and periods – no
spaces).</p>
<p>For ligatures you have the option of specifying whether you want these ligatures
output in an afm file.</p>

<img alt="../../_images/script-lang-dlg.png" class="align-left" src="../../_images/script-lang-dlg.png" />
<p>The script dialog allows you to enter scripts and languages. Again you may edit
these directly or press on the little rectangles to get a list of friendly
names. If you choose to bring up the language dialog you may choose more than
one language in it (use the control key to make disjoint selections).</p>
<p>After you have created a lookup you may add subtables to it. In most cases you
will only need to create one subtable, but for contextual or kerning lookups you
may need two or more (the second would contain a set of kerning classes, while
the first would contain any special cases).</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Add</span> <span class="pre">Subtable]</span></code> button will prompt you to name the new subtable, and will
then bring up a dialog to allow you to edit the commands, the data, of that
subtable. You may also bring up this dialog by selecting an existing subtable
and double clicking on it (or by pressing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Edit</span> <span class="pre">Data]</span></code> button). The
format of the dialog will depend on the lookup type.</p>

</div>
<p>Many of the basic substitution dialogs are very similar. Most of the dialog
contains a list glyph names (one per line) on the left, and a list of
substitution glyph names on the right. So in the example above left, the ‘smcp’
feature will map the glyph named “a” to the glyph named “a.sc”, “b” to “b.sc”
and so on. The multiple and alternate substitution dialogs allow a list of
replacement glyph names on the right. In a multiple substitution the glyph will
be replaced with all the glyphs named on the left, while in an alternate
substitution the word processor will provide the user with a menu from which to
pick a glyph. The ligature substitution is backwards in that the replacement
glyph is the one on the left – if the glyphs on the right appear together and
in order then they will be replaced with the glyph on the left. So if an “f” is
followed by an “f” then it will be replaced by an “ff” ligature glyph.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Populate]</span></code> button will fill the dialog with all glyphs in any of the
scripts for which this dialog is active. If FontForge can figure out a default
replacement glyph then it will in provide that as the default value (if it can’t
figure out a good replacement it will just leave the right side blank).</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Add</span> <span class="pre">Selected]</span></code> button works in much the same way, but will only add
glyphs selected in the font view.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Default</span> <span class="pre">Using</span> <span class="pre">Suffix:]</span></code> button will behave similarly (except it will
only insert entries for which FontForge can find a replacement, and glyph name
of that replacement will be found by appending the specified suffix to the glyph
name of the base glyph).</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Remove</span> <span class="pre">Empty]</span></code> button will remove any entries with no replacement
glyph(s). The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Delete]</span></code> button will delete the currently selected row.</p>
<p>The various radio buttons and check boxes at the top of the dialog control how
the base glyphs are ordered in the display – either in &lt;&gt;Alphabetic order (by
glyph name) or in Unicode code point order. If [] By Base Char is checked then
composed characters like “Egrave” will be ordered closer to “E” than to “Eth”.
If [] By Scripts is checked then glyphs of one script system will be grouped
together no matter how they are ordered alphabetically or unicodally, thus “A”
would be grouped with “B” and not with “Alpha”.</p>

<p>The single glyph positionioning lookup can potentially be quite complex, but
generally in any specific case very little of that complexity is used and the
dialog can be simplified. The lookup allows four different adjustments to each
glyph:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The glyph may be moved left or right by a certain number of em-units</p></li>
<li><p>The glyph may be moved up or down by a certain number of em-units</p></li>
<li><p>The glyph’s horizontal advance width may be altered by a certain number of
em-units</p></li>
<li><p>In fonts with vertical metrics a glyph’s vertical advance may be altered by a
certain number of em-units</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to this you may provide pixel adjustments that apply to specific
point sizes. At small pixel sizes (such as those used for screen fonts) the
rounding error introduced by converting from em-units to pixels may be as large
as the movement itself. In the example at right, if the ‘subs’ feature is
applied to the glyph “a.sinf” that glyph should be moved downward by -560
em-units. Then if the pixel-size of the rasterization is 10 pixels, it should be
moved down a further pixel, while if the pixel-size is 12 it should be moved up
a pixel.</p>
<p>The [] Hide Unused Columns check box will toggle between the two views above
(well, not quite, I added two device table adjustments in the image on the
right, so the adjustment column would remain after checking the checkbox).</p>
<p>Often all the adjustments in a subtable will be the same (the ones here are) so
the [*] Default new entries to first check box will give all new entries the
same value as the first line.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pair-positioning-kerning">

<h3>Kerning format dialog<a class="headerlink" href="#kerning-format-dialog" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<img alt="../../_images/kerningformat.png" class="align-right" src="../../_images/kerningformat.png" />
<p>When you create a kerning subtable you will first be asked whether you want to
create a kerning class subtable, or a kerning subtable with a list of glyph
pairs.</p>
<p>In either case, FontForge will ask if you want to it to automagically fill up
the sub-table with guesses at appropriate kerning values. This is called
“autokern”ing.</p>
<p>In addition, FontForge can guess appropriate glyph classes for kerning by
classes.</p>
<p>If you aren’t interested in autokerning and want to do everything by hand, most
of this dialog is irrelevant, you are only interested in the two radio buttons
at the top and the [OK] button at the bottom.</p>
<p>But if you are interested in autokerning, you need to tell FontForge how closely
it should kern glyphs, and what glyphs to kern. In addition if you want
FontForge to pick kerning classes for you, you must specify the maximum
allowable amount of cumuliative error between two glyphs before they must be in
separate classes.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Default</span> <span class="pre">Separation</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Min</span> <span class="pre">Kern</span></code> fields are used in AutoKerning. The
goal of kerning to to make the optical separation between all glyphs to be
constant, and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Default</span> <span class="pre">Separation</span></code> field specifies that desired value. The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Min</span> <span class="pre">Kern</span></code> value is simply to prevent the dialog from filling with useless
junk. If AutoKerning suggests that two glyphs should be kerned by 1 em unit then
this won’t make any difference to the human eye and there is no point in
including it. So if the kerning value (in absolute value) suggested by AutoKern
is less than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Min</span> <span class="pre">Kern</span></code> then fontforge will ignore that value. Selecting
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[]</span> <span class="pre">Touching</span></code> makes AutoKerning work in a slightly different way, instead of
trying to make the optical distance be the desired value this attempts to make
the minimum separation be the desired value (This is rarely useful, but
occasionally people want to set text where the letters actually touch one
another). The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[]</span> <span class="pre">Only</span> <span class="pre">kern</span> <span class="pre">glyphs</span> <span class="pre">closer</span></code> flag means that FontForge will only
generate negative kerning offset, which will move glyphs closer together.</p>
<p>Below these fields are two panes which look rather like fontviews. Here you may
specify the selections you want to describe the glyphs being autokerned. There
are two of these panes because you usually have a slightly different set of
glyphs of interest on the left and right sides of a kerning pair. In English, a
capital letter will rarely occur in the middle of a word, so you don’t need it
on the right side of a kerning pair. (Of course there are exceptions:
“FontForge” uses an internal capital, but that is rare and if you want to save
space in your font tables you can ignore it). Similarly the closing quote
character will almost never be on the left side of a kerning pair.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kerning-pairs">
<h3>Kerning pairs<a class="headerlink" href="#kerning-pairs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="figure align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/subtable-gpos-kernpair.png" src="../../_images/subtable-gpos-kernpair.png" />
</div>
<p>The kerning class dialog is described in its
<a class="reference internal" href="../mainviews/metricsview.html#metricsview-kernclass"><span class="std std-ref">own section</span></a>, while the kerning pair subtable
dialog is described below.</p>
<p>Each entry in the dialog specifies a pair of glyphs and then adjustments that
may be made to each of those glyphs. Each glyph may be adjusted by any (or all)
of the four adjustments mentioned above, so there are eight potential
adjustments (and possibly device tables for each of those).</p>
<p>In practice kerning tends to use only one of those 8 adjustments. For left to
right text this is generally the horizontal advance of the first glyph
(x_adv#1), for right to left kerning the horizontal advance of the second glyph
is used instead, and for vertical top to bottom text the vertical advance of the
first glyph (y_adv#1). Again, the [] Hide Unused Columns may be used to simplify
the dialog.</p>
<p>Each time you enter a new combination, FontForge will try to guess a kerning
offset for you (autokerning). So the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Separation</span></code> text fields have a similar
meaning to that which they had above – with the exception that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Min</span> <span class="pre">Kern</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Only</span> <span class="pre">kern</span> <span class="pre">closer</span></code> fields will be ignored for individual pairs.</p>
<p>For more elaborate usage, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[AutoKern]</span></code> button will look at all combinations of
glyphs in all scripts in the feature attached to this lookup. The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[AutoKern</span> <span class="pre">Selected]</span></code> button will look at all combinations of glyphs which are
selected in the fontview (Neither of these will override existing combinations).</p>
<p>Below the value matrix is a visual display of the currently selected kerning
pair. You may adjust the kerning value by moving the second glyph around.</p>
<p>You may select a pixel size at which to rasterize your glyphs. You may also
request to see that rasterization magnified (Note: This is different from just
rasterizing at twice the pixelsize, each pixel will be twice as big and the
effects of rounding errors will be more obvious). Magnification is probably only
useful if you are working on device tables for screen pixelsizes.</p>

<div class="section" id="undo-system-interaction">
<span id="lookups-lookups-undoes"></span><h3>Undo System Interaction<a class="headerlink" href="#undo-system-interaction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Changes made to kerning pairs are tracked by a font level undo system. If you
have made no changes to the lookup then no new undo record will be created. The
undo system will track only the minimal amount of information needed to recreate
the old kerning table. This is useful when you are editing a very complex
kerning table which might have thousands of kerning pairs and requires many
megabytes of storage just for the kerning table.</p>
<p>The font level undo system will allow you to undo all of the edits you have made
in a single interaction with the kerning class dialog. For simplicity, let us
consider the scenario where you open the kerning class dialog and edit a few
kerning pairs, then select the OK button. We will refer to this as a single
“round” of editing.</p>
<p>If you have only changed two pairs in a round of editing then only two pairs are
remembered by the undo system so that the kerning table can be restored to how
it was before your performed this last round of edits.</p>
<p>To undo the changes you have made in a round, select the Undo Font Level menu
option from the edit menu in the font view window.</p>

<p>Marks (diacritical accents, vowel marks, etc.) may be attached to base glyphs
using anchors. In the latin script, the grave, accute and circumflex accents
might all attach to their base glyph at the same point, so these would all live
in one anchor class. The dot below accent attaches at a different point and
would need a different class.</p>
<p>You may create as many anchor classes as you like. One mark may not be in
multiple attachment classes, but a base glyph may.</p>
<p>Anchor classes may also be used in cursive systems such as Urdu where the text
slopes up the page. Each glyph has an entry point and an exit point, and the
entry of a glyph will be attached to the exit of the preceding glyph.</p>
<p>Marks may also be attached to marks. Vietnamese will often stack accents on top
of one another.</p>
<p>Finally, ligatures may have several attachment sites, one for each ligature
component.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/anchorcontrol-base.png" class="align-right" src="../../_images/anchorcontrol-base.png" />
<p>The above dialog may be used to create a set of classes for each type of anchor
subtable, then click on the <a class="reference internal" href="anchorcontrol.html"><span class="doc">[Anchor Control…]</span></a> button to
view the marks anchored to bases glyphs.</p>
<p>One glyph is selected (in this case a base) and its anchor point is displayed
relative to it (the blue star in the first pane after the controls). Subsequent
panes show all possible mark attachments.</p>
<p>You may adjust the pixelsize of the display and the magnification factor (again
the magnification factor is most useful if you are looking at small pixelsizes.</p>
<p>You may provide device table adjustments for each pixelsize.</p>
