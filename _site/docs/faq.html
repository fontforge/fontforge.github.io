<dl>
<dt><strong>Why a font editor, aren’t there enough fonts already?</strong></dt><dd><p>Well… no. Otherwise I wouldn’t be writing this, and. more to the point,
there wouldn’t be thousands of people downloading it every month.</p>
<p>I am often asked this question; to me it represents a misapprehension. You
wouldn’t go up to a paintbrush maker and ask if he thought there were already
enough watercolor paintings. A font is a work of art and represents the
individual genius of its creator. It is no more redundant than a watercolor.</p>
<p>However, accepting the question at face value, here are my attempts to answer
it… er, pragmatically.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>There are lots of latin fonts. There are far fewer greek, cyrillic, indic,
thai, chinese, japanese, korean, unicode…</p></li>
<li><p>There aren’t many good quality free fonts available.</p></li>
<li><p>Researchers into old writing systems often need to design their own fonts</p></li>
<li><p>Even for latin, traditionally each new style of art and architecture has an
associated style of fonts. New fonts are always being created to reflect the
esthetics of the times.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer font technology is constantly changing. A font-format that was
useful 10 years ago may not be so now.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if you are satisfied with the fonts that do exist they may not be
complete</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Missing ligatures</p></li>
<li><p>Missing accented glyphs</p></li>
<li><p>No matching cyrillic or greek glyphs</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Everybody wants a font of his/her own handwriting.</p></li>
<li><p>Playing with fonts is fun.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>FontForge has uses beyond simply creating and modifying fonts. It can convert
from one format to another. It can extract information from the font file. Or
it can simply show you what the font looks like without having to install it.</p>

<dt><strong>Why do I give it away?</strong></dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Because I approve of free software and hope that the availability of good
products on a good operating system will encourage people not to use
proprietary systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Because programming is a lot more fun than marketing and giving things away
is easier than selling them.</p></li>
<li><p>Because I’d have to spend more time doing QA if I sold it (and QA isn’t much
fun).</p></li>

<dl id="faq-native">
<dt><strong>Why doesn’t it use the native MS Windows or Mac windowing system?</strong></dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>FontForge is not a commercial product and is not bound by the constraints of
the market.</p></li>
<li><p>Doing that port doesn’t interest me.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t have time nor do I have the skill to take that task on.</p></li>
<li><p>I’d like to encourage people to use Linux/unix</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, if I were to use either <a class="reference internal" href="#faq-widget-set"><span class="std std-ref">gtk or qt</span></a> some of
the difficulties of porting would vanish. But unfortunately I don’t like
either of those widget sets.</p>
<p>Now… if <em>you</em> would like to do the port, that would be wonderful. I
encourage you to do so.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="faq-widget-set">
<dt><strong>Why is FontForge based on a non-standard widget set?</strong></dt><dd><p>I wanted a widget set that would handle Unicode reasonably well. In
particular I thought support for bidi text was important for hebrew and
arabic typography. As I was unaware of any widget sets that did that, I wrote
my own.</p>
<p>I also wanted a widget set where I could actually figure out whether the
checkbox was checked or not checked. In far too many cases my eyes can’t work
out which is which… (Ironically the most frequent complaint I get is from
people who can’t tell whether my checkboxes are checked. I don’t know what to
make of that).</p>
<p>I realize now that that there are essentially two free widget sets that are
far better at unicode support than mine. These are
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt">QT</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.gtk.org/">gtk</a>. I’m still not using either because:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Converting from one set of widgets to another is tedious. And people send me
bugs which distract me.</p></li>
<li><p>If I spend my time doing that conversion I won’t be making FontForge more
functional.</p></li>
<li><p>QT is written in C++, and, <a class="reference internal" href="#faq-c-plus-plus"><span class="std std-ref">as I explain below</span></a>, I
don’t like C++, so that’s out.</p></li>
<li><p>The more I look at gtk the less I like it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The support for images is atrocious (which is odd, since it was written for
gimp):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is no support whatsoever for client side bitmaps (and I want to support
bitmap fonts)</p></li>
<li><p>Colors are ordered RGB in color tables for index images, but BGR for 24bit
color images</p></li>
<li><p>No simple support for transparent images without resorting to full RGBA
images, which is a bit of overkill when I want to draw a simple bitmap.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no overarching format for images, so I can’t have an image which
itself knows whether it’s bitmap, index or truecolor.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixing these was possible, but it involved a lot of very low level work on my
part – and I only know how to do that work on X.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>I find the file chooser dialog really ugly. And it’s so complex I can’t
figure out how to modify it to make it look nice (by my standards, that is).</p></li>
<li><p>I also can’t figure out how to modify the file chooser to make it behave the
way the fontforge’s file chooser currently behaves (popup windows showing
FontNames as you move the mouse over fontfiles, a pull down list of recently
used files attached to the filename input box, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>gtk+2 doesn’t run natively on Mac OS, and the only people porting gtk to the
mac seem to be working on gtk-1</p></li>
<li><p>Many of the widgets I want to use have been deprecated. Sometimes I can’t
figure out what replaces them, sometimes I am forced to used a far more
complex widget instead.</p></li>
<li><p>So I tend to wrestle with it for a while and then decide than my current
widgets are better after all.</p></li>
<li><p>I did get a limited version of fontforge running under gtk. I would be
greatful if someone else would choose to extend and maintain it.</p></li>

<dt><strong>Why isn’t FontForge written in C++ (or *Why C++ is not my favorite language*)?</strong></dt><dd><p>I’ve been a little surprised to be asked this question, I had not realized my
choice of language needed justification, but it appears to do so…</p>
<p>Basically because I don’t find object-oriented practices helpful in most
cases, because I find C++ far too complex and badly designed, and because I
can’t debug it easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I grew up with SIMULA and dabbled with SmallTalk and found after a few years
that there were very few problems where an object oriented approach seemed
natural to me. In most cases it just seemed to impose unneeded complexities
on the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>The semantics of a C++ program cannot be specified. The compiler is free to
generate temporaries as it wishes. In C this is not a problem, but in C++ the
creation of a temporary can involve calling a constructor and a destructor
which may have untold side-effects. I find this frightening.</p></li>
<li><p>The order of execution of external constructors is unspecified. I have seen
many inexplicable bugs caused by this</p></li>
<li><p>I find it extremely difficult to debug C++. Stepping through a statement
often involves many unexpected procedure calls (some of which are inlined and
not obvious). This distracts from my main purpose in debugging.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally I find the language badly specified and too complex. Its various
concepts do not fit well together. Each compiler seems to do things slightly
differently.</p>
<p>I first met C++ in about 1981 when it was called C with Classes. I wrote the
C++ front end for Green Hills Software’s compiler suite from 1987 to 1994 and
I tracked each new version of the language from 1.1 to ANSI.</p>
<p>Each version added new features which did not sit well with the old ones.
Each version was badly specified. The reference implementation was wildly
different from the specification. For example the behavior of virtual
functions inside constructors was not specified until version 2 of the
language and since this behavior was different from naive expectations this
caused bugs. My favorite confusion occurred in (I think it was) the version
2.1 specification where on one page, within a few paragraphs, the following
two sentences occurred: “Unions may contain member functions.” and “Unions
may not contain member functions.”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The above are my personal opinions based on my experience and explain why <em>I</em>
do not use C++. Your opinions probably differ, few people have spent 5 years
writing C++ compilers.</p>

<dt><strong>Why do I release FontForge with the BSD license and not GPL?</strong></dt><dd><p>I just don’t like GPL. It’s partly prejudice, partly real.</p>
<p>I don’t like forcing restrictions on people.</p>
<p>I’m giving away fontforge, so I do.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fontforge/fontforge/master/LICENSE">BSD license</a>
says “Don’t sue me, and include my copyright notice if you use my code” and
that’s all I care about.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am naif, but I don’t believe that anyone is going to start selling
fontforge. Why would they? It makes no sense for someone to try to sell what
I give away freely. If they add functionality to fontforge, then that’s a
different matter, but in a sense they aren’t charging for fontforge, they are
charging for the code they have added to it. It would be annoying if someone
did that, a bit rude in my eyes, but I’m not going to say “no”.</p>
<p>Now someone might take a small piece of fontforge and use it in something
else. That doesn’t bother me. I know that some of my OpenType code has been
snagged by some TeX packages. And I have snagged code for generating
checksums from some other packages.</p>
<p>I rather like helping other people. And people have helped me.</p>

<dl id="faq-libraries">
<dt><strong>Why does FontForge load libraries at run time rather than being linked with them?</strong></dt><dd><p>I dislike dependencies. The fewer the better.</p>
<p>I hate when I download a package and discover it won’t work unless I download
half a dozen other packages (which, in their turn may demand that I download
yet more packages).</p>
<p>I want to download a package and just have it work.</p>
<p>So I try to write as much code myself as I can and release it all together in
a lump and not force people to wander all over the web looking for disparate
parts.</p>
<p>When I can’t figure out how to do something myself I will use an external
library if I must. Even then I will try to insure that fontforge will run if
the library is not present on a system. When I release a binary package I
don’t want to have to release 32 packages per host depending on the possible
presence or absence of 5 different libraries. But I also don’t want to force
someone to install a library that s/he will never use just to get fontforge
to start.</p>
<p>If a user will never look at an svg glyph then they don’t need to install
libxml2. If the user will never import a jpeg image (and there’s really no
reason to want to do that) then they don’t need to install libjpeg.</p>
<p>Instead, the binaries I release will try to load a library dynamically
(dlopen) <em>when they need it</em> and not before. This will also speed up starting
fontforge. If the library is on the system then all is happy and nice. If the
library is not, then that functionality is lost – but the rest of fontforge
continues to work.</p>

<p>Mostly because I don’t thnk that way. I don’t plan things out, I have a vague
idea where I want to go and I explore in that direction.</p>
<p>Consider python scripting. I decided to add python to fontforge. I found that
meant it became easier to design a mechanism so users could create their own
scripts to add import/export file formats. And then startup scripts, and
scripts when certain standard “events” happened. And then I could allow users
to define their own menu items. And then I figured out how to add fontforge
to python (as opposed to the reverse). And now I realize that there is no
reason I couldn’t define a set of c-bindings so that people could call
fontforge as a library from within C programs. And who knows where that will
lead – if anywhere.</p>
<p>Each stage means I can see a little further, and go a little further, and
then see a little more.</p>
<p>And often ideas will come from users, someone will ask for functionality I
had not thought of.</p>
<p>I did maintain such a page for a while. I found that half the things I wrote
never happened, and most of the time I didn’t bother to update the page. I’d
forget about it. It was dull. Far better to <em>do</em> that to simply speculate on
what I might do were I not speculating.</p>
<p>So don’t ask me what will happen next, because I don’t know either. It’s an

<p>I like to make things. I like to make things that – in some strange

my pots – I think I make beautiful pots. And I really like the glazing I put

<p>It’s harder to say that a font editor is beautiful. But I think the ideas

it’s what I want, but I think it’s beautiful.</p>

<dl id="faq-legal">
<dt><strong>Is it legal to modify a font? Is it ethical?</strong></dt><dd><p>Many current fonts are based on the work of great designers from centuries
past – so reusing other people’s designs has a long history. On the other
hand, no matter what the law, it is clearly unethical to steal the work of a
living designer.</p>
<p>Legal matters vary from country to country (and perhaps within countries).
You really should consult a lawyer for a definitive answer. Here are some
guidelines:</p>
<p>Look at the license agreement you received with the font and see what it has
to say on this issue.</p>
<p>TrueType (and OpenType and potentially CID-keyed fonts) have a field in the
OS/2 table called FSType which allows the font designer to place restrictions
on what other people can do with the font. If this field prohibits
modification fontforge will ask you to make sure you have an agreement with
the font designer which supersedes this field.</p>
<p>My understanding of US law (but check with a lawyer before relying on this)
is that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is minimal legal protection for font designs. Ages ago some legal
figure claimed “The alphabet is public.” This meant a type design could not
be copyrighted.</p>
<p>However (I’m told) a designer may register (with the government) for a design
patent which protects the design for 14 years (if granted). I don’t believe
it can be renewed, but I may be wrong.</p>
<p>Registering for a patent is an expensive and time-consuming process and is
often outside the ability of a small design firm. As far as I know the law
has never been tested in the US so the protection may be questionable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Font <em>programs</em> (such as a postscript or truetype font file, but not a bitmap
font file) may be copyrighted. This means the design itself is not protected,
but the mechanism for creating it is.</p></li>
<li><p>Font names may be trademarked.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My understanding is that in the UK:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>There is something called a “design right” which is somewhat like a copyright
and protects a design for 5 years. A designer may also register the design
with the government up to 5 times to extend this protection to 25 years.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the EU:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>There are EU design rights. I’m not sure about the specifics of these, nor
how they interact with country specific laws (as the British design rights
above).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In Canada:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Font designs may be registered as “industrial designs” for a limited time
(~15 years)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I would welcome any additions or corrections here, as well as info on the
laws governing fonts in other countries. There is a
<a class="reference external" href="http://typophile.com/node/42709">thread on typophile</a> which discusses
this.</p>

<dt><strong>What is a 12 point font?</strong> <strong>(What measurement of the font determines the point size?)</strong></dt><dd><img alt="_images/pointsize.png" class="align-right" src="_images/pointsize.png" />
<p>A font is 12 points high if the distance between the baselines of two
adjacent lines of (unleaded) text is 12 points.</p>
<p>The pointsize is not based on the sizes of any of the glyphs of the font.</p>
<p>Back when fonts were made out of metal, the pointsize of the font was the
height of the metal slugs used for that font.</p>
<p>In some sense this is not a very good measure of the size of a font (some
fonts may allow more room for accents or ascenders or descenders than others
meaning that the height of the actual glyphs will be smaller).</p>
<p>There is also a measurement scheme based on the x-height of the glyphs.</p>
<p>In England and the US a point has traditionally meant the pica point
(1/72.27:sup:<cite>th</cite> of an inch), while in Europe the point has been the didot
point (1/67.54:sup:<cite>th</cite> of an inch). The Europeans have a slightly larger
point, but the glyphs of English and European fonts appear the same size.
English does not use accents (except in very rare cases) while most European
languages do, and the slight increase in the size of the point allows more
room for accents.</p>
<p>(Of course now most Europeans are probably forced to use the pica point by
their desktop software, while most computer fonts now contain accented
glyphs, so the distinction and the reason for it may have vanished).</p>

<dl id="faq-linespace">
<dt><strong>How do I set the line spacing on a font?</strong></dt><dd><p>It depends on the kind of font you are generating, the operating system under
which you are running, and luck.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For Type1 fonts there is no way to set the line spacing. Applications will
often take the values specified in the font’s bounding box and use those to
set the line spacing. This is a really bad idea on their part, but it is
common practice.</p></li>
<li><p>For True/Open Type fonts the answer is complicated.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On the mac</p>
<p>The line spacing is set by the ascender and descender values of the ‘hhea’
table. These in turn are set to the bounding box values of the font. Not a
good choice. You can control these values from
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/fontinfo.html#fontinfo-ttf-metrics"><span class="std std-ref">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;OS/2-&gt;Metrics</span></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On windows</p>
<p>Line spacing is supposed to be set to the Typo Ascent/Typo Desent values
specified in the OS/2 table. And these in turn are supposed to sum to the
emsize. (FontForge sets these values to the ascent/descent values you specify
for your font). Unfortunately most windows applications don’t follow this
rule, and instead base linespacing on the Win Ascent/Descent values of the
OS/2 table. These values are supposed to specify a clipping region for the
font (not line spacing). The clipping region should be as big as the font’s
bounding box, but in some cases needs to be bigger. Again these may be set
from <a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/fontinfo.html#fontinfo-ttf-metrics"><span class="std std-ref">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;OS/2-&gt;Metrics</span></a>.</p>
<p>(The clipping region should be bigger than the bounding box if a GPOS lookup
could move a glyph so that it extended beyond the bounding box (mark to base
is likely to cause problems). I’m not sure how this applies to cursive
positioning in Urdu where GPOS lookups can make lines arbetrarily tall)</p>
<p>MicroSoft has added a redundant bit to the OS/2 table, which essentially
tells applications they should follow the standard and use the Typographic
linespacing fields. This bit is called UseTypoMetrics in OpenType, and in
FontForge it is available as
<span class="menuselection">Element ‣ Font Info ‣ OS/2 ‣ Metrics ‣ Really Use Typo Metrics</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On linux</p>
<p>I don’t know that there is a general consensus. An application will probably
use one of the above methods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually this is not a very useful question any more. Modern fonts tend to
have several different scripts in them and the different scripts may have
different line spacing requirements. Even within one script there may be
differences (English uses no (or extremely few) accented letters, while most
other European languages use accents, thus English could be set more densely
than German).</p>
<p>Instead of having one global measurement which controls the line spacing for
all uses of the font, it is better to have more specific measures which
control the line spacing dependent on conditions. The OpenType
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/baseline.html"><span class="doc">‘BASE’ table</span></a> does this. It allows you to specify extent
data depending on script, language and active feature (for example, a ‘mkmk’
feature might increase the line spacing). I don’t know whether any
applications actually make use of these data</p>

<dl id="faq-em-units">
<dt><strong>How big will my glyphs be?</strong></dt><dd><p>Unfortunately this seemingly simple question cannot be answered. Your glyphs
may be any size. Outline glyphs may be scaled and even bitmap glyphs will be
different sizes depending on the screen resolution.</p>
<p>Suppose instead that you have an outline font that you draw at 12 points.
Then we can answer the question.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a dash glyph that is 500 internal units long, and the font
has an em-size of 1000 units. Then your glyph will be 500/1000 * 12 = 6points
long. On a 72 dpi screen this will mean the dash is 6 pixels long.</p>

<a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/fontinfo.html#fontinfo-ps-general"><span class="std std-ref">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;General</span></a> to provide an
em-size for your font. This is the sum of the typographic ascent and descent
(in the days of metal fonts, the height of the metal slugs, the baseline to
baseline distance). Generally the em-size will be 1000 or 2048. This gives
you the number of internal units (also called em-units) used to represent em.</p>
<p>Within fontforge outline glyphs are displayed using the coordinate system

<dl id="faq-x-install">
<dt><strong>Unix &amp; X</strong></dt><dd><dl>
<dt>Outline fonts and fontconfig</dt><dd><p>Many programs now use fontconfig to find fonts (including fontforge).
To install a font for fontconfig, simply copy the file into your

</dd>
<dt>Bitmap fonts, and vanilla X11 installs</dt><dd><p>I’d suggest that you look at the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Font-HOWTO.html">linux font HOWTO file</a>,
and the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/FDU/">font deuglification HOWTO</a>
as good starting points. But I’ll run over the highlights</p>
<p>Essentially you designate one (or several) directories as a “font
directory”. You move your fonts to that directory. You build up certain
data structures that X needs, and you tell X to include this directory
in your font path. Sadly different versions of X and the X font server
use slightly different conventions. You may need to alter these
procedures a bit.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to install a <em>bdf font</em> called frabnuts-13.bdf
then you might:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ mkdir my_fonts
$ mv frabnuts-13.bdf my_fonts
$ cd my_fonts
$ bdftopcf frabnuts-13.bdf &gt;frabnuts-13.pcf
$ mkfontdir
$ xset fp+ `pwd`
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and your fonts should be installed. After that, whenever you start X
you need to remind it of where your fonts live, so you should add</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ xset fp+ /home/me/my_fonts
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>to your .xsession (or equivalent).</p>
<p>If you want to install <em>postscript fonts</em></p>
<p>You should generate them as postscript binary (.pfb) files, then move
both the .pfb and the .afm file into (one of) your font directory(ies)
and run
<a class="reference external" href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=type1inst">type1inst</a>
in it.</p>
<p>type1inst will probably complain that your font doesn’t have a foundry
and will probably get the encoding wrong. You can either:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Ignore it and nothing bad will happen</p></li>
<li><p>Manually edit fonts.scale after running type1inst to fix these entries</p></li>
<li><p>Make your font’s Copyright be reasonable, and then edit type1inst and
add your foundry (directions for this are in type1inst itself)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to install <em>truetype fonts</em></p>
<p>You move the .ttf file into your font directory and run mkttfdir and
mkfontdir.</p>
<p>(<a class="reference external" href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=mkttfdir">mkttfdir</a>
has a small problem with fonts created by FontForge, it will almost
invariably complain that it doesn’t recognize the foundry. You can
safely ignore this, but if it bothers you then add a line to ttmkfdir.c
at 936</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">&quot;PFED&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;FontForge&quot;</span> <span class="p">},</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Some versions of X (ie, those shipped by redhat) rely on the x font
server to do font work rather than the X server itself. You may need to
use chkfontpath to add your new directory to the font server’s font
path (rather than xset fp).</p>
<p>You may also need to insure that the font directory (and all its parent
directories) are readable to world. (the font server runs as a
non-privileged user)</p>
<p>I haven’t seen anything that says X supports <em>opentype</em> fonts yet, but
since freetype does (and I think X’s rasterizer uses freetype) then X
might support them too. Installing them will require manual editing of
fonts.scale though (mkttfdir uses freetype1 which doesn’t support otf
files).</p>
<p>That sounds really confusing. I apologize, I’m not a good writer and
there are too many choices in configuring X…</p>

Generate the font into a different directory and then use windows drag and
drop to install the font. (Windows appears to do magic when it moves the font
into that directory).</p>
<p>Recently (2009) a windows security patch decided that fonts with a ‘name’
table bigger than 5K were insecure and refused to install them. Frequently
this is caused by having the full text of a license included in the font.</p>
<p>I am told that fonts produced by old versions of FontForge will not install

<p>I believe this problem is fixed now (as of 20-Oct-2003). If you have an older

<dt><strong>How do I edit fonts from my macintoy?</strong></dt><dd><dl>
<dt>Mac OS/9 (or less)</dt><dd><p>Traditionally the macintosh has stored fonts in the resource fork of files
(after about OS/8.5 I believe the mac also supported bare .ttf files).
This causes problems for any machine other than a mac, because the very
concept of a resource fork is lacking.</p>
<p>There are several programs whose job it is to store all of a macintosh
file in one package that can be manipulated on other systems (mac binary
and binhex are the most common). FontForge knows how to read both of these
formats and can extract a postscript or truetype font from either.
FontForge can also create fonts in macbinary format (I see no reason to
support both output formats, and macbinary is slightly simpler).</p>
<p>So to edit a font on your mac:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Find the file in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">System</span> <span class="pre">Folder:Fonts</span></code> folder</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the file over to your unix machine</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use Fetch and specify macbinary format</p></li>
<li><p>Or use some tool like binhex which can create the file directly</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Open it in FontForge</p></li>
<li><p>Edit it</p></li>
<li><p>Save it back in macbinary format</p></li>
<li><p>Copy it back to your mac</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fetch will automatically undo the macbinary wrappers and make it be
correct</p></li>
<li><p>Or various other tools can unwrap it.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Drop it back into your system folder (where it is automagically moved to
Fonts)</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure you either replace the original font files, or that
you rename the font within fontforge and (for postscript fonts) that you
give it a new unique id. See the <a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/fontinfo.html"><span class="doc">Font Info</span></a> dlg.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> A postscript font is useless on a macintosh unless it is
accompanied by at least one bitmap font. If you generate a postscript font
make sure you also generate an NFNT as well (this has the FOND).</p>
<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> The mac is picky about the filename used to contain a
postscript file. It is based on the postscript font name but suffers a
transformation. Don’t try to rename this file. Basically the rules are
(see
<a class="reference external" href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/0091.Mac_Fond.pdf">Adobe Technical Note 0091</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The fontname is broken into chunks where each chunk starts with a capital
letter.</p></li>
<li><p>The first chunk may have four lower case letters following the initial
capital</p></li>
<li><p>Subsequent chunks may only have two lower case letters following the
capital.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-letter glyphs (or at least hyphens) vanish.</p>

<dt>Mac OS/X</dt><dd><p>On Mac OS/X you can run FontForge directly. OS/X has several font
formats, some fonts are stored in the old format (see above), while others
are stored as data fork resources. The data fork font files generally have
the extension “.dfont”. On a Mac FontForge is able to edit both formats
directly. OS/X also supports normal .otf and .ttf font files.</p>
<p>Mac OS/X does not seem to support the old NFNT bitmap format, but it still
requires that a bitmap font in NFNT format be present before it will use a
resource-based postscript font. (It is probably not the NFNT resource
which is required, but the FOND which goes along with it. But I’m not
going to write something to produce a bare FOND resource – nothing else
does either).</p>

</dd>
<dt>Leopard (10.5) and before</dt><dd><p>For the Style menu in most mac applications to work on your fonts, you
must create a font family. You do this with the
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/filemenu.html#filemenu-generatemac"><span class="std std-ref">File-&gt;Generate Mac Family</span></a> command.</p>
<p>All the fonts in a family must have the same Family name (See the
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/fontinfo.html"><span class="doc">font info</span></a> dialog). Font Families are handled rather
differently under Carbon (the old font handling mechanism used in OS 9)
and under ATSUI (on OS/X).</p>
<p>Under Carbon, the font family is limited by the design of the Mac ‘FOND’
resource, which reflects the computer font technology of the early 1980s.
Modern computer fonts often have variants that can’t be expressed in it.
FONDs support any combination (except one containing both Extend and
Condense) of the following styles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bold</p></li>
<li><p>Italic</p></li>
<li><p>Condense</p></li>
<li><p>Extend</p></li>
<li><p>Underline</p></li>
<li><p>Shadow</p></li>
<li><p>Outline</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Mac FONDS do not support “Black”, “DemiBold”, “Light”, “Thin” or
“Extra-Condensed” variants.</p>
<p>Under ATSUI, on the other hand, a family seems to consist of all fonts in
a given resources file which have the same FamilyName.</p>
<p>In order that a family be useful under both systems, Apple appears to
place several FONDs inside such a font file. Each FOND contains a
sub-family of related fonts. The ‘FOND’s appear to be distributed as
follows:</p>
<p>Suppose you have a family of fonts with the following styles:</p>
<p>Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold-Italic, Condense, Condense-Italic, Oblique,
Light, Light-Italic, Black</p>
<p>Then you should create a font family with the styles that the FOND does
support, which in this case would be</p>
<p>Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold-Italic, Condense, Condense-Italic</p>
<p>For each of these use <a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/fontinfo.html#fontinfo-fondname"><span class="std std-ref">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Mac</span></a>
to set the FondName field to the font’s family name.</p>
<p>Change the fondname of the other styles, so that the Oblique style has
Oblique in the fond name, the two Light styles have Light in the fond
name, and so on. Set the <a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/fontinfo.html#fontinfo-mac-style"><span class="std std-ref">Mac Style</span></a> on the
“Light” variant of the font to be Regular (everything unselected) and set
the style of the “Light-Italic” variant to be “Italic” – that is, forget
about the “Light”, the FOND can’t handle it, that’s why we moved it into
its own FOND.</p>
<p>Having done this setup, the
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/filemenu.html#filemenu-generatemac"><span class="std std-ref">Generate Mac Family</span></a> command should be able
to put all the fonts into appropriate FONDs, and then place all the FONDs
into one file, which the Mac should interpret correctly.</p>

<dl id="faq-new-encoding">
<dt><strong>How I do tell fontforge about a new encoding</strong></dt><dd><p>First ask yourself if you really need a new encoding? If you are using
OpenType or TrueType fonts you can usually get by with the standard unicode
encoding. But if you really need a new one here is a rough idea of what to
do:</p>
<p>Figure out what your encoding looks like. Often this will involve searching
around the web to find an example of that encoding. For instance if you want
a devanagari encoding you might look at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/indic.html">a site which shows the ISCII encodings</a></p>
<p>These encodings only show the top 96 characters, presumably the others are
the same as US ASCII. Look at the images and figure out how they map to
unicode (or more precisely what the appropriate postscript names are for
those characters).</p>
<p>Create a file (call it “Devanagari.ps” in this case). It should start with a
line:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">Devanagari</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This tells FontForge that the encoding is called “Devanagari”, then follow
this with a list of all the character names (preceded by a slash). We start
with ASCII which starts with 32 .notdef characters, then space, etc.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">Devanagari</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<dl id="faq-non-integral">
<dt><strong>Is it safe to use non-integral coordinates?</strong></dt><dd><p>FontForge allows you to edit with non-integral coordinates. Many font editors
don’t and some have wondered if the use of non-integral coordinates will it
distort their fonts when they are rasterized?</p>
<p>The answer depends on the font format and how you save the font.</p>
<p>TrueType fonts can only express integral coordinates. When FontForge creates
a TrueType font it will round all coordinates to integers. This rounding will
introduce a slight distortion in the curve.</p>
<p>PostScript (type1, PostScript OpenType, type2, etc.) fonts can express
non-integral coordinates in the font format – but it takes a lot more space
in the font file. Type1 fonts tend to take more space to express this than
type2 (opentype) fonts. By default FontForge will round to int on these as
well, BUT you can change that in the Generate Options dialog.</p>
<p>If your font is rounded then there will be some distortion. If it is not
rounded there should be no distortion. In PostScript fonts it should be safe
to use non-integral coordinates provided you turn off rounding when you
generate the font. The font file will be bigger, but more accurate.</p>
<p>If you feel you need more accuracy in TrueType you can change the em-size to
8096.</p>
<p>You can do this on PostScript Type1 fonts too, however, there are some
applications which assume that all OpenType postscript fonts have an em-size
of 1000, so it is best not to do this for OpenType output.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="faq-open-size">
<dt><strong>Why isn’t my Open Type font much smaller than the .pfb file?</strong></dt><dd><p>This is probably because you didn’t round to int before saving the font.
FontForge will save the font using fixed point numbers which take up a lot
more space than normal integers.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="faq-open-difference">
<dt><strong>What’s the difference between OpenType and PostScript (or TrueType) fonts?</strong></dt><dd><p>Both PostScript and TrueType define a file format and a glyph format.
OpenType uses the TrueType file format with a PostScript glyph format
(actually OpenType includes the TrueType glyph format as well, but the
OpenType definition says such fonts should still be called TrueType fonts so
I ignore that aspect).</p>
<p>The PostScript used in OpenType is slightly different from that used in .pfa
and .pfb files. pfa/b files are Type1 fonts while OpenType uses Type2 fonts.
Type2 is almost a superset of Type1 with a few minor changes and many
extensions. Adobe’s subroutine based extensions to Type1 (flex hints, hint
substitution, counter hints) have been added to Type2 as direct instructions.</p>
<p>OpenType can also include additional information (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#faq-aat-open"><span class="std std-ref">below</span></a>) that allows for the layout of complex scripts
(Arabic, Indic, etc.) as when as support for glyph variants and other aspects

<dl class="simple" id="faq-aat-open">
<dt><strong>What is the difference between AAT (Apple Advanced Typography) and OpenType?</strong></dt><dd><p>Both of these are extensions to the basic TrueType font which can contain
information for laying out complex scripts (like Arabic or Indic scripts) as
well as support for glyph variants and other aspects of fine typography. They
use totally different internal formats for the more complex aspects of this
task, formats which have different expressive powers so that neither format
can be converted to the other without the possibility for some loss of
information. I discuss this in greater detail</p>

<dt><strong>Why does a font, which worked fine under 10.3 fail on Mac 10.4 (Tiger)?</strong></dt><dd><p>With Tiger (Mac OS/X.4) Apple added some support for OpenType. Some OpenType
features are converted (at runtime) into AAT features. This is good, but not
all features have corresponding Apple feature/settings, and not all lookups
can be converted (conditional lookups cannot be). Unfortunately if a font
contains both OpenType and AAT features Apple now ignores the AAT features
(or so I have been told). The result is that AAT features, which presumably
work, will not be used, while OpenType features, which are not completely
supported and so won’t work, are used instead.</p>

<dt><strong>After I generate a font and quit, why does FontForge ask if I want to save the font? I didn’t change anything.</strong></dt><dd><p>There are two reasons why this might be happening.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Even though you haven’t changed anything in this session, FontForge may need
to (re)generate hinting information on one or several glyphs (if, for example
those glyphs have been changed (in an earlier session) but no hints have been
generated for them since). These new hints will mark the font as changed.</p></li>
<li><p>If your font has an XUID field in the Font Info, then FontForge will
increment the final number in the XUID each time a postscript font is
generated – and this also counts as a change. (Why does FontForge do this?
Because Adobe says it should. A minor annoyance, but it avoids some problems
with font caching when you change an old version of the font for a new one).</p></li>

<dl class="simple" id="faq-tex">
<dt><strong>Why doesn’t TeX work with my fonts?</strong></dt><dd><p>I’m a total novice with TeX. I am told that TeX (or some part of the TeX
chain, dvips perhaps) expects fonts to be encoded in TeX base Encoding –
sometimes called “Adobe Standard” by the TeX docs, but it isn’t it’s TeX
base. So if you are having printing problems, missing glyphs, etc. try
changing the encoding of your font to TeX Base (Go to

<dl id="faq-mf-files">
<dt><strong>Why doesn’t FontForge let me edit an ‘.mf’ file?</strong></dt><dd><p>As Knuth said “(the problem with WSYWYG is that…) What you see is <em>all</em> you
get.” FontForge suffers from this.</p>
<p>Let us take a simple example. Suppose we have a point defined by</p>
<pre class="literal-block">top<sub>1</sub>y<sub>2</sub> = CapHeight</pre>
<p>And the user tries to drag point 2 to a new y location. How should FontForge
interpret this? It could:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Change <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CapHeight</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>Change the width of pen 1</p></li>
<li><p>Change the equation to something like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">top<sub>1</sub>y<sub>2</sub> = CapHeight - 30</pre>
</li>
<li><p>Or to something like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">top<sub>1</sub>y<sub>2</sub> = (CapHeight + XHeight)/2</pre>
</li>
<li><p>Or to half a dozen other things.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So FontForge’s method for moving a point around is ambiguous. And I haven’t
been able to come up with any reasonable way for disambiguating it.
Suggestions are welcome (but there’s no guarantee they’ll be implemented).</p>

<dl id="faq-cidmaps">
<dt><strong>What on earth are cidmap files and should I care about them?</strong></dt><dd><p>Some background:</p>
<p>When postscript was invented every glyph in a font was given a name, and an
encoding which was specified by a 256 element array mapping character codes
to names.</p>
<p>Then they started thinking about CJK fonts (and perhaps Unicode), which have
huge glyph sets, and coming up with reasonable ASCII names for 10,000 glyphs
was <span class="small">a)</span> a waste of space, <span class="small">b)</span> fairly meaningless. So then
adobe created CID-keyed fonts which have no glyph names and no encodings.
Every glyph has an index (a CID), which is just a number, and this is sort of
treated as a name. Then external to the font is an additional resource (a
cmap) which provides the encoding for the font (and can support really grungy
encoding schemes like SJIS), by mapping a sequence of input bytes to a CID.</p>
<p>Adobe provides certain standard cmap resources (ie. one for SJIS, one for
JIS, one for Extended Unix whatever). Because these files are fairly painful
to write Adobe has assigned standard meanings to CIDs so that everyone can
use the same cmap file. – Well actually there are 5 or 6 different
standards, Japanese (JIS208), Japanese (JIS212), Korean, Chinese (Hong Kong,
Taiwan), Chinese (Mainland, Singapore), Identity (Unicode) – So CID 1 might
be space, CID 2 might be “!”, CID 935 might be “Katakana ka”, etc.</p>
<p>My cidmap files just give me a mapping between Adobe’s CIDs and Unicode. This
allows FontForge to know what glyph it is working on. If they aren’t present
things should work ok, but FontForge would fill the font view with “?” rather
than the appropriate glyph. And FontForge wouldn’t be able to reencode the
font into Unicode or anything else.</p>
<p>So the cidmap files are only useful for people working on CID keyed CJK
fonts. So many europeans/americans won’t need them.</p>

<p>First FontForge checks to see if the spline happens to be a quadratic already
(this would happen if you’d just read in a truetype font, or if a miracle
occurred when you generated the spline).</p>
<p>Otherwise FontForge will divide the original spline into smaller chunks and
try to find a set of quadratic splines that differ from the cubic by no more
than one unit anywhere. (Once you have picked two end-points and know the
slope at those end-points there is only one quadratic spline possible between
the two).</p>

<dl id="faq-quadratic-cubic">
<dt><strong>How does FontForge convert a quadratic spline into a cubic (when reading truetype)?</strong></dt><dd><p>This is easy since any quadratic spline can already be represented as a

<p>Most programs which load eps files treat them as black boxes. They will read
the file into memory and output it, unchanged, to a postscript printer.
Unfortunately FontForge cannot do this. FontForge needs to understand and
then convert the eps file into a simpler format (fonts can use far fewer
operations than an eps file). So unlike most programs FontForge must
interpret each eps file – but interpretting all of PostScript is a huge job
and ff is limited in what it understands. Sometimes it will find a file it
can’t handle.</p>

<p>FontForge can generate truetype instructions for you itself, but you must ask
it to do so – use the <span class="menuselection">Hints ‣ AutoInstr</span> command.</p>

<dt><strong>I generated an opentype font and windows wouldn’t install it. Why not?</strong></dt><dd><p>Unfortunately Apple and MicroSoft (and Adobe) do not agree on the proper
format for open and truetype fonts. FontForge has a check box on the Generate
Font Options dialog labelled [] Apple. Make sure this is checked when you are
generating a font for the mac. Make sure this is not checked when generating
a font for Windows (and probably for unix too, though unix tends to be less
picky).</p>
<p>The major differences I’ve stumbled onto so far are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The postscript name entry in the NAME table.</p>
<p>(I am told that this is actually an error in Apple’s version of the spec, and
the behavior of the Mac matches that of Windows).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The names of the tables containing bitmap fonts</p></li>
<li><p>The way scaled references are stored</p></li>
<li><p>And the tables containing advanced typographical features are completely
different</p></li>
</ul>

<dl id="faq-dsig">
<dt><strong>I have a truetype font with opentype tables, but windows displays the “TT” (truetype) icon and not the “O” icon. Why?</strong></dt><dd><p>As far as I can tell Windows will mark a truetype font with the “O” icon if
that font contains a ‘DSIG’ (Digital Signature) table. FontForge does not
produce digital signatures (I think they are of negative utility, and anyway
I don’t know how to create them).</p>
<p>However, it is possible to
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/generate.html#generate-options"><span class="std std-ref">ask FontForge to create a ‘DSIG’ table</span></a> which
contains no signatures. That seems enough to make windows happy.</p>

</dl>
<dl id="faq-names">
<dt><strong>What do all the different font names mean?</strong></dt><dd><p>When <span class="menuselection">Element ‣ Font Info</span> opens it shows a Names pane with
several different fields. Why are there so many and what do they all mean?</p>
<p>The Names pane contains names used in PostScript fonts. There is also a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TTF</span> <span class="pre">Names</span></code> pane which contains a similar set of names used in sfnts (an
sfnt is a font file format which includes truetype, opentype, and a number of
more obscure font formats).</p>
<p>A font may be PostScript wrapped in an sfnt. In this case it can have both a
set of PostScript names, and a set of sfnt (ttf) names. Those names could be
different (that’s usually not a good idea, but they <em>could</em> be).</p>
<p>The “name for humans” is the name traditionally associated with a font. It
might be something like “ITC New Century Schoolbook Italic #4”. It’s a string
which applications can use to display when they want humans to know what the
font is.</p>
<p>The fontname exists because PostScript is a programming language and this is
the name used to identify the font <em>within PostScript</em>. It has restrictions
on the characters which may be in the name (no spaces is the biggest. but it
also can’t look like a number, no parentheses, etc.) and on the length of the
name. It might look like “ITCNewCenturySchoolbook-Italic”.</p>
<p>The family name is the name of a family of related fonts. In the above
example “ITC New Century Schoolbook” would probably be the family name.</p>
<p>“Base Filename” isn’t really a name associated with the font itself. It’s
just there to make your life easier when using fontforge. When you generate a
font, ff will pick a default filename for you (you can always change it, of
course, but it is handy if the default name is the one you want to use).</p>
<p>Normally the default name will be just the fontname with an extension added
(ITCNewCenturySchoolbook-Italic.ttf). But sometimes people want a different
name for the default, perhaps just NewCentSchlBk-Ital.ttf. This lets you do
than.</p>
<p>So it controls the default FILENAME for the file containing the font, and
does not directly relate to anything in the font itself.</p>
<p>The weight string is something like “Bold”, “Black”, “Thin”, etc. It does not
include other stylistic variations (you would not put Italic or Condensed
here).</p>
<p>The copyright string should be self-explanatory.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>In addition to the “Names” pane of Font Info, there is also a TTF Names pane.</p>
<p>In many ways this is a duplicate of the Names pane but with some differences.
It is used to specify names for sfnts.</p>
<p>Here you have</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Family</p>
<p>This corresponds to the PostScript Family</p>
</li>
<li><p>SubFamily</p>
<p>Vaguely like the weight field, but takes all stylistic varients not just
weight.</p>
<p>This might be “Bold”, “Italic”, “Bold Italic”, “SemiBold”, “Condensed”, …</p>
<p>Whatever is appropriate for your font.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fullname</p>
<p>This corresponds to the “Name for humans”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Copyright</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Generally FontForge will set all these fields appropriately (ie. same as in
the Names pane). If you don’t like the name ff chooses you can disassociate
it from the PS name by right clicking on the entry and choosing from the
popup menu.</p>

<dl class="simple" id="faq-mingliu">
<dt><strong>I looked at kaiu.ttf or mingliu.ttf and the outlines looked nothing like the correct glyphs. What’s wrong?</strong></dt><dd><p>Some truetype fonts (kaiu and mingliu are examples) do not store the correct
outline. Instead they rely on using the instructions to move points around to
generate the outline. The outline does not appear to be grid-fit at all, just
positioned. FontForge will not process the instructions as it reads the font.
In most fonts this would be the wrong thing to do, and I don’t know how I
could tell when it needs to be done…</p>

<dt><strong>When I use</strong> <span class="menuselection">Element ‣ Build ‣ Build Accented Glyph</span> <strong>to build one of the Extended Greek glyphs (U+1F00-U+1FFF) FontForge picks the wrong accents. Why?</strong></dt><dd><p>For some reason Unicode has unified greek and latin accents even though they
don’t look at all alike. When FontForge follows the simplistic unicode
definitions it will probably pick a latin accent for greek glyphs.
Fortunately Unicode also contains code points for the greek accents starting
around U+1FBD, if you fill these code points with the appropriate accents
then FontForge will use these rather than the latin accents.</p>

accents over the tallest point on the glyph. If there are several points with
the same height, then an average is used.</p>
<p>If you make all your stems be the same height then the accent should be
properly centered.</p>

<dl id="faq-ttf2afm">
<dt><strong>Why does ttf2afm crash on FontForge ttf files?</strong></dt><dd><p>I don’t know. The ttf2afm that was distributed with my redhat 7.3 linux
certainly did crash. When I downloaded the source from
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/systems/pdftex/">pdftex</a> area of
ctan and built it (with debug) the resultant program did not crash. Therefore
I believe this is a bug in ttf2afm and that bug has been fixed.</p>
<p>The afm files produced by ttf2afm don’t conform to

<dl id="faq-memory">
<dt><strong>My system keeps crashing because FontForge keeps running out of memory. What can I do about it?</strong></dt><dd><p>Buy more memory?</p>
<p>If you are editing large fonts, FontForge may run out of memory. All too
often when FF runs out of memory, the kernel will crash rather than report an
error condition. FontForge does check for failure to allocate and attempts to
free up some chunks of memory when the system returns an error – I’ve never
seen this code activated though.</p>
<p>FontForge does provide a mechanism which might help you avoid this. FontForge
generally wastes a lot of memory keeping undoes around. You can clear undoes
associated with a glyph with the <span class="menuselection">Edit ‣ Remove Undoes</span>
command. You can also limit the number of undoes that will be stored with
each glyph with the
<span class="menuselection">File ‣ Preferences ‣ Editing ‣ UndoDepth</span>.</p>
