<h2>Er… What is a font editor?<a class="headerlink" href="#er-what-is-a-font-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A font editor is a program designed to create and modify fonts.</p>
<p>The most obvious aspect is that it is a drawing program like FreeHand, Inkscape
or Illustrator which lets you draw the outlines of your letters. Unlike other
drawing programs it expects you to draw many pictures at once (one or more for
each letter) and collects them into a database.</p>
<p>It allows you to describe the way these pictures interact with each other (if
you put one picture after the other then they should normally be separated by a
certain distance – the font’s metrics, or if these two pictures are placed
adjacent to one another then they turn into a third – the font’s ligatures, and
so on).</p>
<p>Finally a font editor will bundle up all the pictures you have drawn, and all
the metadata about how those pictures fit together, and will turn that bundle of
stuff into a font that your computer can use to display text.</p>

<p>Most simply a font is a collection of glyphs. But computer fonts must contain
more than this, at the least they must also contain information on how to map an
input string of bytes into an output display of visual glyphs. This mapping is
called an encoding. Many fonts will also contain rules for how adjacent glyphs
should be arranged. For instance, in fonts for the latin alphabet, there is
often a rule saying that if “f” and “i” are adjacent then a special glyph, a
ligature of “f” and “i” should be used instead. Fonts for latin letters
generally do not require such rules (but can be enhanced by them), fonts for
other scripts like arabic require them.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-s-the-difference-between-a-character-and-a-glyph">
<h3>What’s the difference between a character and a glyph?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-the-difference-between-a-character-and-a-glyph" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A character is a concept and a glyph is a reification of that concept. The
letter “A” is a character, while <img alt="As" src="_images/As.png" /> are all glyphs that represent an “A”.
In latin fonts there is often a single glyph for every character and a single
character for every glyph, but not always – in renaissance printing there were
two glyphs for a lower-case s, <img alt="short-long-s" src="_images/arabic-seen.png" /> the short and the long s. Whereas
a ligature is an example of a glyph that represents two (or more) characters.
In arabic most of the letters (characters) have at least four different glyphs,
the appropriate glyph being determined by the letters around it. Here are four
forms of the arabic character “seen” <img alt="arabic-seen" src="_images/short-long-s.png" />.</p>

<h3>What is an outline font? What is a bitmap font?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-an-outline-font-what-is-a-bitmap-font" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each glyph in a font has a shape and there are various ways of describing that
shape on a computer. PostScript and truetype fonts generally describe the
outline of the shape and then color in the interior of that outline, this
coloring process is called rasterizing. On the other hand a bitmap font
describes each glyph by drawing a picture of that character on a rectangular
grid of pixels. There is a third type, a stroked font, where each stem of the
glyph is represented by one line down the center of the stem, and the line is
later drawn with a certain width. Most of the time we will not deal with stroked
fonts directly (the <a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/elementmenu.html#elementmenu-expand"><span class="std std-ref">Expand Stroke</span></a> command can be
used to turn them into outlines), but if you wish to edit stroked fonts, see the
section on <a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/multilayer.html"><span class="doc">multi-layered editing</span></a>.</p>

</div>
<p>An outline is composed of a set of contours or paths. In the picture on the
above left the letter A is described by three different paths. The main one is
on the outside and the two smaller ones are internal. Each of these paths is
composed of a series of (Bézier) splines and line segments. FontForge can handle
cubic and quadratic splines. PostScript fonts use cubic splines, TrueType fonts
use quadratic (SVG fonts can be either).</p>
<p id="overview-spline">Each cubic spline is defined by four points, two of which mark the end points of
the spline and two more to describe the slope of the spline at those end points.
Here are <a class="reference internal" href="techref/bezier.html"><span class="doc">two cubic splines</span></a> with all their points shown:</p>
<img alt="_images/splines.gif" class="align-left" src="_images/splines.gif" />
<p>The points which describe the slope are called control points. They are
represented here (and in fontforge) by little colored x’s. Moving a control
point will change the shape of the spline, but it will not alter where the
spline begins or ends.</p>
<img alt="_images/pnts.gif" class="align-right" src="_images/pnts.gif" />
<p>A series of splines and lines are joined together to make a path. There are
several possible ways to make these joins as is shown in the example to the
right. In each case we have three points in approximately the same relative
positions. The three points are joined by splines or lines, but the type of
joins alters the appearance of the connections.</p>
<p>In the first case there are no control points and the result is two straight
lines, in the second case there is a line and a curved spline which are tangent
at their point of intersection, in the third case there are two splines which
are again tangent at their point of intersection. The point of intersection in
the first case is called a corner point, and the incoming and outgoing splines
or lines may be in any orientation with respect to each other. This is
represented in fontforge by a square box. In the second case the point of
intersection is called a tangent point, it is represented by a triangle. The
third case is a curved point and is represented by a circle.</p>
<img alt="_images/quadraticspline.gif" class="align-left" id="overview-quadratic" src="_images/quadraticspline.gif" />
<p>FontForge can also edit quadratic splines (the splines used in truetype fonts),
here there is only one control point and it controls the slopes at both
end-points. Because of this quadratic splines cannot bend in as many ways as
cubic splines (the first spline above left would need at least two quadratic
splines to draw), and you will often need more splines to achieve the same
curve. You can control whether a font contains cubic or quadratic splines with
the <a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/fontinfo.html#fontinfo-ps-general"><span class="std std-ref">Element-&gt;Font Info</span></a> command.</p>
<p>There are many different types of splines in the world. The ones described above
are Béziers – these are numerically simple and have a number of nice properties
– which is why they are used internally in fonts. However, there are some even
nicer splines. It is easy to give Bézier splines the same slope on either side
of a point, but a curve will look much nicer if it has the same curvature on
either side of a point. Clothoid splines have this property.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.levien.com/">Raph Levien</a> has kindly donated to the open source
community a <a class="reference external" href="http://libspiro.sf.net/">library</a> for converting clothoid
splines into Béziers.</p>
<p>Clothoid splines are much easier to work with than Béziers – there are no
control points, just a sequence of on-curve points, and magically a beautiful
curve will appear between them. FontForge can
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/mainviews/charview.html#charview-spiro-mode"><span class="std std-ref">either</span></a> edit a curve as a set of Béziers or as a set
of clothoids.</p>
<p>A path is closed when it comes back and joins its start. All paths in an outline
font should be closed. Once a path is closed in may be said to have a direction,
essentially this may be thought of as “Was the path created in a clockwise or a
counter-clockwise fashion?” (this is actually a little simplistic, if a path
intersects itself, as in a figure 8, then the direction cannot be described as
either clockwise or counter-clockwise, but most paths do not self-intersect (and
paths in a font <strong>SHOULD NOT</strong> self-intersect) and we will simplify our life by
pretending that we can call paths clockwise or counter).</p>
<p>When time comes to draw our outline glyph we want to make dark everything in the
interior of the outline. But let’s look at the outline of our A above. We have
two paths inside the main outline path, and we want the interior of those two
paths to be white rather than dark. How do we make this distinction? We do it by
the direction of the paths. Consider any point in the glyph. If we draw an
imaginary line from that point out to infinity (in any direction) and count the
number of times we cross a path, each time we cross a clockwise path we add one
to our count, each time we cross a counter clockwise path we subtract one. If
the result of our count is non-zero then we color the point dark, otherwise we
leave it white. So to make the A above work we make the outer path be clockwise
and the two inner ones be counter-clockwise (Things could be done the other way
around, but the convention is that the outer path should be clockwise).</p>
<p>All of these points (both the end points and the control points) are described
mathematically. Each point is positioned on a cartesian coordinate system which
has its origin on the glyph’s <a class="reference internal" href="#overview-baseline"><span class="std std-ref">baseline</span></a> (the line on
which letters without descenders rest). Most font formats expect coordinates to
be integers between -32768 and 32767, FontForge uses real numbers internally but
(usually) rounds to the nearest integer when generating a font file.</p>
<p>Generally it is a good idea to restrict yourself to integral coordinates.
TrueType fonts can only contain integral coordinates so if you use a
non-integral value FontForge will be forced to round it to an integer and this
will alter the shape of the curve. PostScript fonts can contain non-integral
values, but the various formats are optimized for integers. So use integers when
you can. If you need more precision you can increase the “em-size” of the font.</p>
<p id="overview-em-unit">When displaying a font we use the word “em” to represent the size of the font.
If a font is displayed at 12points then 1em will be 12points. If the font is
displayed at 18points then an em will be 18points. (traditionally a 12 point
font is one where the metal slugs are 12 points tall – or where the baseline to
baseline spacing of unleaded text is 12 points, so an em was the size of the
metal.).</p>
<p>When designing an outline font, you can no longer think in terms of points –
these fonts are scalable and can be any pointsize. You must think in terms of
the em and fractions of the em. When you create a font you choose how many
internal units (called “em-units”) to use to represent 1 em – this number is
called the “em-size”. In most PostScript fonts there are 1000 units to the em,
TrueType fonts often have either 1024 or 2048 units to the em (TrueType
recommends that you use a power of two). But you can choose any (positive)
number you like (well, as long as it is less than 32767), the numbers above are
conventions not requirements).</p>
<p>Suppose you have a dash in a PostScript font, and that dash is 500 units long,
and the font has 1000 units to the em. Suppose a someone displays that dash at
12 points. Then that dash will be drawn with a length of 500/1000 * 12 = 6
points. On a 72 dot per inch screen where a pixel is almost exactly one point,
the dash will be 6 pixels long.</p>
<img alt="_images/sidebearings.png" class="align-right" src="_images/sidebearings.png" />
<p>Every glyph has its own coördinate system. The font’s
<a class="reference internal" href="#overview-baseline"><span class="std std-ref">baseline</span></a> (the line upon which most latin glyphs will
rest) is 0 in the vertical direction. The horizontal origin is where the glyph
will start being drawn (what is “drawn” will usually be empty space for a short
while – as there is usually some space between the origin and the edge of the
glyph). This horizontal distance between the origin and the leftmost edge of the
glyph is called the left side bearing (it may be negative, positive or zero).
All glyphs have a width (sometimes called an advance width), this is the
distance from the origin of the current glyph to the origin of the next. The
distance between the right edge of the glyph and the width is called the right
side bearing.</p>
<p>CJK text (Chinese, Japanese or Korean) can be written either vertically or
horizontally, and so CJK fonts usually have a vertical advance width as well as
the more common horizontal advance (and concomittant top and bottom side
bearings).</p>
<p>A glyph like “g” or “y” extends below the baseline, this is called a descender,
while a glyph like “k” or “l” extends above the x-height, this is called an
ascender. Most latin (and greek and cyrillic) fonts have certain standard
heights: the height of a lower case letter (without an ascender) is called the
x-height, the height of a capital letter is called the cap-height, the height of
the ascenders is called the ascender height (some, but not all, fonts have the
ascenders and capitals at the same approximate height). Often these will not be
exactly the same for all glyphs, the letter “O” is usually slightly taller than
the letter “I”, but they both are within the range of the cap height for the
font.</p>
<p>The font itself has an ascent and descent associated with it. In the old days of
metal type nothing could ascend above or descend below these values, nowadays
accents and ascenders may reach above the font-wide ascent and descenders below
the descent, but the concept is still a convenient one to retain. It is true
that in almost all cases the glyphs will not ascend above or descend below the
font-wide ascent and descent. The sum of the ascent and descent is the size of
the font. The point size of a piece of metal type was determined by this value
(essentially the height of the metal block holding the glyph). In a postscript
font the local coordinate system is independent of the final size at which the
font will be drawn.</p>

<p>FontForge can produce many font types. What’s the difference?</p>
<p>PostScript is based on a <a class="reference internal" href="techref/bezier.html"><span class="doc">cubic spline</span></a> technology, while TrueType
is based on a <a class="reference internal" href="techref/bezier.html"><span class="doc">quadratic</span></a> technology. Cubic splines are generally
easier to edit (more shapes are possible with them). Any quadratic spline can be
converted to a cubic spline with essentially no loss. A cubic spline can be
converted to a quadratic with arbitrary precision, but there will be a slight
loss of accuracy in most cases.</p>
<p>Within FontForge a font may contain either cubic or quadratic splines. These are
converted to the appropriate format when a font is generated.</p>
<p>The other major difference between the two is how they solve the problem of
drawing nice images at small pointsizes. PostScript calls this “Hinting”, while
TrueType calls it “Instructing” a font.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-s-opentype">
<h3>What’s OpenType?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-opentype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately the word “OpenType” has come to have several meanings.</p>
<p>The first meaning describes the glyph (and spline) format of the font. In this
sense Open Type is just a postscript font put into a truetype file format –
From the outside it looks like a truetype font except that the outline
descriptions are postscript Type2 font descriptions rather than TrueType.
Technically it is a <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-cff"><span class="xref std std-term">CFF</span></a> font inside an <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-sfnt"><span class="xref std std-term">sfnt</span></a> wrapper.</p>
<p>In a second sense of the word OpenType refers to a set of tables containing
advanced typographic information. These tables may be added to either fonts
specified with quadratic splines (truetype) or fonts with cubic splines.</p>
<p>Finally MS Windows uses an OpenType icon for a font if that font contains a
‘DSIG’ (Digital Signature) table.</p>
<p>To make things even more confusing the OpenType specification includes the old
TrueType specification, so technically any TrueType font can be called an
OpenType font.</p>
<p>FontForge does not support the DSIG table (if you want one there is a free tool
from MS which will add one). When generating a font, FontForge uses the term
“OpenType (CFF)” to represent a PostScript (CFF) font inside an sfont wrapper.
To include OpenType typography tables you would press the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Options]</span></code> button

<p>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) provides a relatively new font format, written in
an xml dialect. SVG fonts can be either cubic or quadratic (or can use both, but
FontForge is limited and will force a font to be either all cubic or all
quadratic). SVG allows for two different types of fonts, one corresponds roughly
to PostScript Type1 fonts, and the other, roughly to PostScript Type3 fonts.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-are-type3-fonts">
<h3>What are Type3 fonts?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-type3-fonts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Back in the early days of PostScript, the Type1 format was proprietary, only
Adobe could make Type1 fonts, but anyone could make Type3 fonts. Type3 fonts
were unhinted, but could include any postscript command and so could produce a
wider range of pictures (multi-colored glyphs, stroked glyphs, glyphs based on
scaled images, etc.). Most of the time these extensions are unnecessary, and the
disadvantage of being unhinted is onerous – but sometimes you want to play.</p>

<p><strong>PostScript</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Adobe incorporated several different ways of providing hints for the
rasterizer about how things should be treated. The most obvious of these are
the horizontal and vertical stem hints. Each glyph has its own set of hints
to tell the rasterizer where to find stems. FontForge can usually figure out
a reasonable set of stem hints (a process called
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/hintsmenu.html#hintsmenu-autohint"><span class="std std-ref">autohinting</span></a>), but some glyphs are too complex for
it and it can make bad choices. It also provides a mode for you to override
its choices.</p>
<p>Adobe also has a mechanism for handling dished serifs called flex hinting.
This means a curve that is only slightly deformed from the horizontal (or
vertical) will display as a line at small point sizes and as a curve at
larger ones. FontForge will use these when it seems appropriate.</p>
<p>The original version of hints did not allow them to overlap, this meant that
most serifs could not be described, Adobe then developed a mechanism called
hint substitution which allows for different sets of non-overlapping hints to
exist in different parts of the glyph. There are still shapes which cannot be
fully hinted, but hint substitution is an improvement. The
<span class="menuselection">Hints ‣ AutoHint</span> command will figure out what stems
overlap and where to change the current set of hints. The
<span class="menuselection">Hints ‣ Hint Substitution Pts</span> command will also figure
where hint changes should occur, and the Hint Mask pane of the Point Info
dialog gives the user direct control over this.</p>
<p>Most recently Adobe has provide a means to control the counters, the spaces
between stems, in a glyph. The original Type1 description provided support
for the horizontal counters in “m” and the vertical counters in “E” but more
complex shapes could not be dealt with. Counter Hints (in a type1 font) may
only be used with non-latin (non-greek, non-cyrillic) glyph sets, in type2
(OpenType) things are a bit more complicated,. FontForge will generate
counter hints when appropriate.</p>
<p id="overview-hintorder">Adobe provides some font-wide hinting mechanisms. The two most obvious are
the BlueValues and StemSnap settings in the
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/fontinfo.html#fontinfo-private"><span class="std std-ref">private dictionary</span></a>. BlueValues provides a list of
vertical zones in which interesting things happen (so in a latin font this
might include the ascender height, the cap-height, the x-height, the baseline
and the descender height. At small point sizes everything within one of these
zones will snap to the same height, while at larger point sizes the heights
will be slightly different (for instance an “o” and an “x” usually have
slightly different heights, but displaying that at a small point size would
be ugly). Similarly the StemSnap variables specify standard stem widths for
the font. FontForge will try to guess reasonable values for these. It also
allows you to override these guesses and
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/fontinfo.html#fontinfo-private"><span class="std std-ref">specify your own values</span></a>. For a more comprehensible
description of the private dictionary and what it can do, look at
<a class="reference external" href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/PDFS/TN/T1_SPEC.PDF">Adobe’s Type1 font specification</a>.</p>
<p>FontForge’s <a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/hintsmenu.html#hintsmenu-autohint"><span class="std std-ref">AutoHint</span></a> command will work better if
the BlueValues have been set. So before running AutoHint go to
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/fontinfo.html#fontinfo-private"><span class="std std-ref">Element-&gt; FontInfo-&gt; Private</span></a> to set this array.
After AutoHinting you should regenerate the StemSnaps (also at
<span class="menuselection">Element ‣ FontInfo ‣ Private</span>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, True Type says that figuring out what pixels to turn on
would be a lot simpler if only the points and the splines were in the right
place (ie. at pixel boundaries). And so True Type provides a set of
instructions that move points around until they are positioned appropriately
for a given size.</p>
<p>FontForge’s hinting of True Type (properly called “instructing”) is based on
the stem hints also used by PostScript and on diagonal hints. It uses these
hints to determine which points to move and where to move them.</p>
<p>When FontForge reads in a TrueType font it will store the instructions used,
and when it next generates that font it will use those instructions –

<div class="section" id="references">
<span id="overview-references"></span><h2>References<a class="headerlink" href="#references" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In addition to a set of outlines (splines) glyphs may be built out of references
to other glyphs. This is especially handy for the accented glyphs, “à” can be
made up of a reference to the “a” glyph and another reference to the
“`” glyph. This can result in significant space savings, and in ease of design
(if you change the “a” glyph after making a reference to it the “à” glyph will
automatically change too, whereas if you just copied the “a” you would have to recopy it.</p>
<p>FontForge has three commands for manipulating references, and one higher level
command for building accented glyphs. The
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/editmenu.html#editmenu-reference"><span class="std std-ref">Edit-&gt;Copy Reference</span></a> command will put a reference to
the current glyph into the clipboard, which a subsequent
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/editmenu.html#editmenu-paste"><span class="std std-ref">Edit-&gt;Paste</span></a> command will install as a reference. The
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/editmenu.html#editmenu-unlink"><span class="std std-ref">Edit-&gt;Unlink Reference</span></a> command will turn a reference in
a glyph into it’s component splines. The
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/elementmenu.html#elementmenu-info"><span class="std std-ref">Element-&gt;Get Info</span></a> command (when applied to a
reference) will bring up a dialog showing you what glyph is referred to, and
allowing you to bring up an editing window on that glyph. Finally the
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/elementmenu.html#elementmenu-accented"><span class="std std-ref">Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Accented Glyphs</span></a> command will
figure out what glyphs should be refered to to build this composite glyph, and
then will make those references and position them appropriately. So if “à” were
selected and you did a
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/elementmenu.html#elementmenu-accented"><span class="std std-ref">Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Accented Glyphs</span></a> command, FontForge
would make a reference to “a” and another to
“`”, and place the accent above the letter, and centered on it.</p>
<p>Some bitmap formats (OK, only one that I’m aware of) support references, so
FontForge allows references in bitmap glyphs as well as in outline glyphs.</p>
<p>Sadly life is not always that simple. The references FontForge uses internally
cannot always be converted into something equivalent in the output font.
Generally this causes no problems (FontForge will simply unlink the reference in
the output, which just makes the font a little bigger, but it has implications
for instructing TrueType, and, to a lesser extent, hinting PostScript. Most
people can ignore this, but if you are interested
<a class="reference internal" href="techref/ref-caveats.html"><span class="doc">follow this link</span></a>).</p>
<p>Most font formats require that a glyph contain either a set of outlines (or
bitmap rasters) or a set of references. FontForge allows glyphs with a
combination of the two, but, as above, when it comes time to output the results,
FontForge will clean up the glyph (generally by unlinking references) so that it
can be output in the current format.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="layers">
<span id="overview-layers"></span><h2>Layers<a class="headerlink" href="#layers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A font may have several layers. When FontForge creates a new font it will have 2
real layers (the foreground and background layers) and a sort of half-layer for
guidelines which is shared by all glyphs. In normal fonts all glyphs have the
same number of layers (This is not true of Type3 fonts, and
<a class="reference internal" href="#overview-type3"><span class="std std-ref">I’ll talk about them later.</span></a>)</p>
<p>Both the foreground layer and the background layer have certain predefined
meanings: The foreground layer is the default layer for dialogs where there is
no clear way to specify a layer. The background layer can contain all sorts of
stuff, basically whatever you want it to, but any images in it may be autotraced
into the foreground layer.</p>
<p>You may add other layers with the
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/fontinfo.html#fontinfo-layers"><span class="std std-ref">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Layers</span></a> pane. Each layer may have a
name and a different kind of splines (quadratic or cubic).</p>
<p>One potential use of addtional layers: Many people find it easier to edit using
cubic splines but like to produce truetype fonts with quadratic splines. You can
use one layer to hold the cubic splines and another to hold the quadratics.
There are commands for comparing layers
(<a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/elementmenu.html#elementmenu-comparel2l"><span class="std std-ref">Element-&gt;Compare Layer To Layer</span></a>) and others for
copying one layer to another (and adjusting the splines to fit the new layer:
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/editmenu.html#editmenu-copyl2l"><span class="std std-ref">Edit-&gt;Copy Layer To Layer</span></a>).</p>
<p>It seems a shame to have both a valid cubic and a valid quadratic font in a
database and only be able to produce a font from one of them, so the font view
will allow you to switch between layers
(<a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/viewmenu.html#viewmenu-fvlayers"><span class="std std-ref">View-&gt;Layers-&gt;*</span></a>) and
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/generate.html"><span class="doc">File-&gt;Generate Fonts</span></a> command will allow you to output whatever
layer you want into the font. (Note that all layers will share the same hints,
instructions, character set, bitmaps, etc. It is only the outlines which
differ.) Furthermore, you may choose to store all the layers of a font into an
sfnt (TrueType / OpenType font) with the
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/generate.html#generate-options"><span class="std std-ref">[]Layers checkbox of the PfaEdit table of the [Options]</span></a>

you want to, FontForge can. Here each layer represents a different drawing
operation, and may specify a different color, stroke, fill, etc. Layers are not
font-wide, each glyph has its own set of layers (which are not named). You can

individual layer for each glyph). It can be edited just like any other layer and
you may have guidelines of any shape you desire. You may also drag out

<div class="section" id="scripts">
<span id="overview-scripts"></span><h2>Scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#scripts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A script is a collection of letter shapes and rules for putting letters
together. For instance the latin script consists of the letters A-Z, written
left to right, along with a transformation from upper to lower case, a few
ligatures and rules for generating accents. Arabic is a script consisting of its
own character set, written right to left, along with transformations for
initial, medial, final and isolated forms, many ligatures and rules for placing
vowel marks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="glyph-names-namelists">
<span id="overview-glyph-names"></span><h2>Glyph names &amp; Namelists<a class="headerlink" href="#glyph-names-namelists" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Within fontforge every glyph will have a name. Generally the glyph name will be
something that provides information about what the glyph looks like so the name
for the glyph representing “9” is “nine”. Adobe has established a
<a class="reference external" href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/aglfn13.txt">standard for what names may be assigned to what glyphs</a>,
and when producing a font for general use it is best to stick to that standard
(Acrobat uses the glyph names and recognizes the standard ones. If you try and
use “neuf” for “nine” Acrobat will not recognize it and surprising things will
fail).</p>
<p>Adobe’s standard provides reasonably mnemonic names for most latin and greek
glyphs (to English speakers anyway), some rather incomprehensible names for
cyrillic and hebrew (afiiXXXXX) and identifies most other glyphs by unicode code
point (uniXXXX or uXXXXX where “X” represents a hex digit and XXXX is the
unicode code point in hex).</p>
<p>If you are an english speaker and you are working with latin glyphs this is fine
and dandy. But if you are French you might wish that “adieresis” were named
“atréma” – for that matter even if you are an English speaker you might prefer
it to be named “aumlaut”. No matter who you are you might prefer more mnemonic
names for the code block you are working on.</p>
<p>FontForge has a concept called a <a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/encodingmenu.html#encodingmenu-namelist"><span class="std std-ref">namelist</span></a>, each
of which is simply a mapping from unicode code point to name. Several namelists
may be defined, different lists may apply to different fonts and a font may have
all its glyphs renamed from one namelist to another.</p>
<p>Namelists can also help navigating in a font. Even if a list does not apply to a
given font its names may be used in the goto dialog to find glyphs. So if you’ve
loaded a french namelist you can search for “atréma” and FontForge will show you
the glyph “adieresis” or “uni00E4” or “aumlaut” or whatever.</p>
<p>A few caveats: Adobe’s glyph name standard expects all glyph names to be in
ASCII characters. Syntactically postscript permits a wider range of glyph names,
but if you use non-ASCII characters some rasterizers might have problems. Best
to keep non-ASCII names within fontforge (and rename glyphs to adobe’s standard
names before generating a font).</p>

<div class="section" id="lookups-features-scripts-and-languages">
<span id="overview-lookups"></span><h2>Lookups, Features, Scripts and Languages<a class="headerlink" href="#lookups-features-scripts-and-languages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OpenType (and Apple Advanced Typography) allow various transformations to be
applied to the input glyph stream to produce an output glyph stream. These
transformations might include forming ligatures, kerning glyphs closer to each
other, attaching vowel marks or diacritics to letters, conditionally replacing
one glyph with another depending on the glyphs around it, etc.</p>
<p>The commands for each transformation are stored in what are called lookups. If
you were designing a set of lookups to handle latin ligatures, you might have
one lookup for ff, fl and ffl – ligatures that happen almost all the time,
another for fi and ffi – ligatures which don’t happen in Turkish but do in
other languages, and lookups for ct and st – ligatures which rarely happen in
English but are more frequent in German (I think).</p>
<p>A Feature is a tagged collection of lookups. The tags are all 4 letter sequences
(like ‘liga’) with standardized meanings. The ‘liga’ tag means standard
ligatures. The ‘dlig’ tag means discretionary ligatures, and ‘kern’ means
kerning. There are many others.</p>
<p>Every script (latin, cyrillic, han ideographs, …) will have its own set of
features that are meaningful to it. Sometimes things will be even more
complicated, and each language within a script will have it’s own set of
features. In the example above we might assign scripts, languages, features and
lookups thusly:</p>

writing systems, not just Latin and are considered Common to most scripts. If
you have lookups which apply to the digits (conversion to oldstyle digits, or to
proportional digits, or to superscripts…) you should attach those lookups to
features in all scripts (and languages) that could use them, and to the default
script (just in case).</p>

<p>There are roughly 15 different types of lookups which contain different

<h3>Lookup subtables<a class="headerlink" href="#lookup-subtables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I talk above about lookups as if they were simple things. Unfortunately they
aren’t. Each lookup is composed of “Subtables” which actually do the work.</p>
<p>A lookup may contain several subtables. Most contain exactly one. (If a lookup
contains no subtables it will do nothing).</p>
<p>I said there were about 15 kinds of lookup, there are even more kinds of
subtable. For instance a subtable which specifies glyph to glyph kerning is
different from one which specifies glyph class to glyph class kerning.</p>
<p>At first glance the subtable may seem an unnecessary complication, but it turns
out to be desirable for one lookup to contain several kinds of sub-table data.
For instance, a kerning lookup might include one subtable providing glyph class
kerning, and then another subtable providing exceptions to that on a glyph by
glyph basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-lookups-are-applied">
<h3>How lookups are applied<a class="headerlink" href="#how-lookups-are-applied" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When a word processor deals with text, it will figure out what script is in use
in the text. Somehow it will figure out what the language is (maybe it will just
assume the “DFLT” language, maybe the user told it the text was in French, maybe
the locale is Spanish, …).</p>
<p>In any script/language some features are applied by default, while others may be
applied at the user’s discression. So in English the “liga” feature should
always be applied, while the “dlig” feature should only be applied if the user
asked for it. (Not all programs follow this at the moment, but that’s the
theory).</p>
<p>The word processor will build up a list of features that might be active. Then
it looks in the font and sees which of those features are available for this
script and language. In turn each feature is composed of lookups, and all
lookups in all active features will be marked as active.</p>
<p>Lookups will be executed in the order in which they occur in the lookup list
(which is also the order shown in the <span class="menuselection">Font Info ‣ Lookup</span>
pane, but may be quite different from the order in which the features were
listed). And all active lookups will be executed.</p>
<p>This ordering can be important. If you have both a small-caps lookup and a
ligature lookup active, and the text is “fi” then the order of the lookups will
probably matter. If the small-caps lookup happens first then the “fi” will
become “<span class="small">FI</span>” and the ligature feature will not be applied. If the
ligature happens first then you will see an “fi” ligature for which there is
probably no small-caps glyph. In one case you get small-caps, in another a
ligature. Probably, here, you would like the small-caps lookup to happen first.</p>
<p>Lookup subtables make life even more interesting. When a lookup is executed the
subtables within that lookup are activated in turn <em>until one succeeds</em>. After
that no further subtables will be applied.</p>
<p>So in the kerning example mentioned above, you would want to put the special
case glyph to glyph subtable first, and then the glyph class to class subtable
second. When a special case combination occurs the first subtable will succeed
(and kern the combination) and the class subtable will not be used. For
combinations which aren’t special cases, then the first subtable will fail, and
the second will be applied.</p>

<div class="section" id="gpos-and-gsub">
<h3>GPOS and GSUB<a class="headerlink" href="#gpos-and-gsub" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Up till now I have spoken as there were one list of lookups. That was a
simplification. There are two broad classes of lookup, and two lists. There are
those involved in manipulating the glyphs themselves (glyph substitution,
ligation, decomposition, etc.) and those involved in positioning glyphs relative
to others (kerning, mark attachment, etc.).</p>
<p>The GSUB table contains all the glyph substitution lookups and <em>all</em> of them
will be processed before any positioning lookups are attempted.</p>
<p>The GPOS table contains all the glyph positioning lookups.</p>

<div class="section" id="anchor-points-and-classes">
<span id="overview-anchors"></span><h2>Anchor Points and Classes<a class="headerlink" href="#anchor-points-and-classes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Anchor points allow fine control of the positioning of two (or several) glyphs.
There are several different styles of attachment based on anchors: cursive, mark
to base, mark to ligature and mark to mark positioning. The first style is used
to join glyphs in flowing scripts (cursive) where the exit from one glyph joins
the entry point of the next. In the second style one of the glyphs is the base
glyph, and it will be positioned normally, the other glyph which will often be a
diacritic or vowel mark will be positioned so that the anchor points in each
glyph are coincident. Mark to ligature behaves similarly to mark to base except
that there may be more that one attachment point on the ligature depending on
which component a given mark is connected to. Finally, mark to mark allows you
to position two marks with respect to each other (as you might need to do in
vietnamese or hebrew where you may get several marks for one glyph).</p>
<p>That is badly said. Consider the following two glyphs and how they are joined to
make the final result:</p>

<p>The grave accent has been raised and moved to the right so that its anchor point
is positioned where the anchor from “a” was.</p>
<p>FontForge does not compose these glyphs (well, it can, but that’s a completely
different area), instead it provides information within the
<a class="reference internal" href="techref/gposgsub.html"><span class="doc">font</span></a> to a text layout program so that the program can do the
composition.</p>
<p>The example above is unlikely to be very useful since most latin fonts contain
pre-composed a-grave glyphs, but the same concepts apply to arabic and hebrew
where the number of variants is larger and the precomposed glyphs fewer.</p>
<p>That’s roughly how anchor points are used. Now the mechanics.</p>
<p>Each of the different attachment styles mentioned above (cursive, mark to base,
mark to ligature and mark to mark) is a different type of GPOS lookup. If you
want to do attachment positioning you must first create the appropriate lookup
(<a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/fontinfo.html#fontinfo-lookups"><span class="std std-ref">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Lookups-&gt;GPOS</span></a>, then a lookup
subtable, and then an anchor class within the lookup subtable. An anchor class
is specified by providing a name for it (in the above example the class was
called “Top”).</p>
<p>Cursive attachments are a little different from the other attachment types. Each
glyph has two attachment points, an entry and an exit (instead of just the one
shown in the mark to base example above). The text layout program will attach
the exit point of one glyph to the entry point of the next.</p>
<p>A glyph may contain several Anchor Points, but only one for each mark to base
anchor class (ligatures may have more than one for a class, and ‘curs’ and
‘mkmk’ classes will usually have two). Inside a glyph may create a point with
the <a class="reference internal" href="ui/menus/pointmenu.html#pointmenu-addanchor"><span class="std std-ref">Point-&gt;Add Anchor command</span></a>. You must specify an
anchor class, and whether this point is in a base glyph or in a mark glyph, and
a location. So in the example above the anchor point in “a” has class “Top” and
is a base glyph, while the anchor point in “grave” also has class “Top” but is a
mark glyph. There may be many base glyphs with an anchor point named “Top” and
many mark glyphs also with “Top” anchor points. Any base glyph with a “Top”
anchor point maybe composed with any mark glyph with a “Top” anchor point. So
instead of specifying the exact composed form for all possible combinations we
specify far fewer anchor points for the same effect.</p>
<p>But life is not really that simple. Ligatures may need several anchor points of
the same class (one above each component for example). When you create your
anchor point you may say that it is to be in a ligature, in which case you will
also be asked for a ligature index – a number running from 0 to the number of
components in the ligature -1. This allows you to position several anchor points
with the same class. The text layout program will place the first mark over the
first anchor point, the second mark over the second and so on (this is a gross
simplification).</p>
<p>Finally you may need to position two marks based on the same anchor point, for
example the glyph <img alt="a_dieresis_macron" src="_images/a_dieresis_macron.png" /> has a diaeresis and a macron over it.
Both of which might normally be positioned with the Top anchor class. Instead
we define a special class for positioning one mark with respect to another.
When creating the anchor class specify a tag of ‘mkmk’ (mark to mark) and call
it something like “TopMark”. When you create a new anchor point for diaeresis
you specify that it is a <em>base mark</em> and you position it above the glyph, while
the new anchor point in macron should be of type mark and should be positioned
at the same place as the “Top” anchor point. Thus when given the sequence of
glyphs “a diaeresis macron” the text layout program should position “a”
normally, position “diaeresis” so that the its Top anchor point is where “a“‘s
is, and position macron so that its TopMark anchor point is where
“diaeresis“‘s is.</p>
<p>Anchor points may be selected, dragged, transformed, cut, copied and pasted.</p>

<span id="overview-baseline"></span><h2>Baselines<a class="headerlink" href="#baselines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To a user of the latin alphabet it makes sense for the vertical origin of a
glyph to be the baseline on which most letters rest <img alt="latinBaseline" src="_images/latinBaseline.png" />. This means
that if you change the pointsize of a glyph it will still line up properly
<img alt="latinNormalBaseline" src="_images/latinNormalBaseline.png" />. This is so obvious we don’t even think about it. But if
you put the vertical origin at the top of the letter then the letters will be
aligned quite differently, and to our eyes, unexpectedly <img alt="latinHangBaseline" src="_images/latinHangBaseline.png" />.</p>
<p>Different scripts have different expectations of how glyphs should be aligned.
In latin (cyrillic, greek, arabic, hebrew, etc.) the alignment point, the
baseline, is somewhere in the middle of the possible extent of a glyph – that
is the script has both ascenders above the baseline and descenders below it.</p>
<p>But not all scripts are like that. In Devanagari the alignment point is near the
top of the glyph – indeed most glyphs will draw in the baseline explicitly
<img alt="devaBaseline" src="_images/devaBaseline.png" />. If you change the pointsize you want glyphs to line up on this
line <img alt="devaHangBaseline" src="_images/devaHangBaseline.png" />, and not down at the bottom of the glyph
<img alt="devaLatinBaseline" src="_images/devaLatinBaseline.png" />.</p>
<p>In CJK ideographs the baseline is usually drawn at the bottom edge of the square
which contains the glyph.</p>
<p>However if you try and typeset these different scripts together with their
baselines in the same place you get a mess:</p>
<img alt="_images/misalignedBaselines.png" src="_images/misalignedBaselines.png" />
<p>It would be much nicer if it were possible to say that these different scripts
have their baselines in different places so that the glyphs can fit together
reasonably:</p>
<img alt="_images/alignedBaselines.png" src="_images/alignedBaselines.png" />
<p>Both Apple Typography and OpenType allow for this. There is a
<a class="reference internal" href="ui/dialogs/baseline.html"><span class="doc">baseline table</span></a> which says how the baselines for each script
(or each glyph) should be aligned with respect to other baselines.</p>

<div class="section" id="font-view">
<span id="overview-fontview"></span><h2>Font View<a class="headerlink" href="#font-view" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="ui/mainviews/fontview.html"><span class="doc">font view</span></a> displays all the glyphs in the font (or all that
will fit in the window). Every line has two parts, at the top is a label, often
small clear letters, underneath that, somewhat larger is a 24 pixel
rasterization of the font you have designed. As you edit a glyph in an
<a class="reference internal" href="#overview-charview"><span class="std std-ref">outline glyph view</span></a> its small version in the font view
will change as you work.</p>
<p>Double-clicking on a glyph will bring up an outline glyph view of that glyph
which will allow you to edit it.</p>
<p>Selecting several glyphs will allow you to apply various operations to all of
them, or to cut and paste them.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="ui/mainviews/charview.html"><span class="doc">outline view</span></a> is probably the most complex view in
FontForge. This is where you actually edit the splines
(<a class="reference internal" href="techref/bezier.html"><span class="doc">Bézier splines</span></a>) that make up your glyphs.</p>
<p>You may have a background image loaded into the view to help you trace out the
shape you are working on (it is displayed in grey). There are various grid lines
visible, some created by default (the baseline, the ascent line, the descent
line, and a line at x=0), you may add others yourself.</p>
<p>There is a layer showing the glyph’s hints.</p>
<p>In the foreground are the splines and points of the glyph itself, and the width
line (you may adjust the glyph’s width by moving this line). If a point is
selected then its control points will be displayed.</p>
<p>To the left of the main window (the image below shows them on the right, that
was just to keep them from crowding things, you can move them around) are two
palettes, one a palette of tools, and the other a palette controlling what
layers (foreground, background, grid, hints) are visible and editable.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="ui/mainviews/bitmapview.html"><span class="doc">bitmap view</span></a> is similar to the outline view above. It
also has a tools and layer palette.</p>
<p>This allows you to edit bitmap versions of the outline glyphs you create above.</p>
<p>In the background is a small rendition of the outline, and in the foreground are
the bits of the image. You may make the program calculate which bits should be
set by pressing the “Recalculate button”, the results usually need to be tweaked
by hand. In the upper left corner is a full sized image of your bitmap glyph.</p>
