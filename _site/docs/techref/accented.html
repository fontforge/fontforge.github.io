<h1>Building Accented and other Composite Glyphs<a class="headerlink" href="#building-accented-and-other-composite-glyphs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>You can use the <span class="menuselection">Element ‣ Build ‣ Build Accented Glyph</span>
command to build up accented glyphs. Or you can use
<span class="menuselection">Element ‣ Build ‣ Build Composite</span> and build slightly more
general composite glyphs (ligatures and so forth). The accented version will not
create ligatures and will not replace Alpha with A. The composite version will
do both these things. My assumption is that ligatures (like the “fi” ligature)
usually need a bit of work on the user’s part to get them to look good, in the
case of “fi” the dot on the “i” needs to be fused into the hook of the “f”, and
if you are careless with the command you might destroy your work inadvertently.</p>
<p>What can be built?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unicode specifies various normative glyph decompositions. So “Aacute” is defined
to be an “A” with an “acute” accent centered on top. Any of these can be built
(though if the glyph contains no accents it will need to be built with the build
composite command).</p>
<p>Sometimes Unicode’s normative definition is not as informative as it might be
(many of the greek accents are “unified” with latin accents that they don’t
really look like, the result is that following Unicode slavishly will yield the
wrong glyph). So in some cases FontForge will use a slightly different set of
glyphs than the normative decomposition.</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Latin accented characters</p></li>
<li><p>Latin ligatures (ae, oe, fi, fl, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Greek accented characters</p></li>
<li><p>Cyrillic accented characters</p></li>
<li><p>Hebrew ligatures</p></li>
<li><p>Arabic ligatures</p></li>
<li><p>Fractions, digits inside parens, roman numerals, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The predefined Hangul characters (0xac00-0xdfaf)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Many of the Korean Jamo are actually ligatures of other Jamo (ssangkiyoeok
(0x1101) is composed of two kiyoeok (0x1100)). For some reason this information
is not normative unicode, but FontForge is aware of it anyway and will build
those glyphs if you ask it to.</p></li>
<li><p>The glyphs “i” and “j” can be built by adding a dot accent to the dotlessi and
dotlessj glyphs</p></li>
<li><p>The dotlessi and dotlessj glyphs can be built by removing the dot from an “i” or
“j” glyph</p></li>
<li><p>If a glyph name has an extension, as “agrave.sc”, then it will be built out of
the same components as “agrave”, except FontForge will use the variants of those
components named with the same extension. So “agrave.sc” would be built out of
“a.sc” and “grave.sc”. If the accent variant does not exist then FontForge will
also try the bare accent “grave”.</p></li>
<li><p>FontForge knows a few other things. It knows that Greek “Alpha” and Cyrillic A
both look like the Latin “A” and will replace either if you ask. (as well as all
the other similar glyphs in latin, greek, cyrillic, cherokee, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Some glyphs are just extremely simple to build. There are a whole slew of glyphs
which correspond to zero-width spaces. FontForge will build any of them. More
usefully it will build any of the fixed size spaces 0x2000-0x200f, and the fixed
sized rules 0x2010-0x2015).</p></li>
<li><p>You may use the <span class="menuselection">Element ‣ Char Info</span> dialog to define a
ligature yourself, and FontForge will build it for you.</p></li>
<li><p>In Adobe’s CID glyph sets there are some pre-rotated versions of latin glyphs.
When CJK text is written vertically the convention is that any text in western
alphabets should be displayed rotated 90º clockwise. If you apply Build Accented
Glyph to one of these slots it will find the appropriate latin letter and rotate
it properly.</p>
<p>If a glyph’s name is “vertcid_&lt;cid&gt;” where &lt;cid&gt; is a decimal number, then it is
assumed to be a vertically rotated version of the glyph at &lt;cid&gt;. In
non-cid-keyed fonts, if a glyph’s name is “vertuni&lt;uni&gt;” where &lt;uni&gt; is a four
digit hex number, then it is assumed to be a vertically rotated version of that
unicode glyph.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So for each selected glyph in the font view (or for the current glyph in the
outline view), and if all the base glyphs and accents needed by the glyph have
already been created then this command will delete anything that is in the
current layerand put a reference to the base glyph and another reference to the
accent glyph into the foreground. So if the current glyph were “À” then a
reference to “A” would be added to it, and a reference to</p>
<p>If <a class="reference internal" href="../ui/menus/editmenu.html#editmenu-from"><span class="std std-ref">Copy From</span></a> is set to All Fonts then any bitmaps will
have a similar process done – that is to say, bitmap references will be created
(even in the outline glyph view).</p>
<p>Choosing accents can be a slightly tricky process. Unicode says that accented
letters are logically built out of the accents in the range 0x300-0x340, but
this does not work too well in postscript. A Type1 font works better if the
accented glyph is in the Adobe Standard Encoding, which means either using
accents around 0x2d0 or ascii glyphs. FontForge will first attempt to find an
accent around 0x2d0, then in ascii and finally in the 0x300-0x340 range. Even
worse, Unicode unifies the greek and latin accents, so for greek letters
FontForge will look for accents around 0x1fbd (FontForge will also require the
presence of the double accents like 0x1fdd).</p>
<p>Some of Adobe’s fonts have accents designed for use over upper case letters (the
nomal accents are designed for lower case), and accents designed for use over
cyrillic letters. So in such a font, if you attempt to build “Agrave” FontForge
will build it out of “A” and “Grave” (or “grave.cap”, not the standard “grave”).</p>
<p>Not all accents should be centered above the base glyph, a cedilla is (usually)
centered underneath the base, while other accents need to be placed to the left
or right, or even overstruck. FontForge should know about proper placement of
most accents (or at least a rough approximation thereto).</p>
<p>Some Unicode glyphs contain more than one accent. Additional accents will be
treated similarly. This command can also be used to generate more general
composite glyphs .</p>
<p>Some accents (for example cedilla) are treated unexpectedly on certain letters
(different ways in different languages), so be careful of g-cedilla. Å often
merges the ring into the top of the A, but here it will float above it. <strong>Be
alert</strong>.</p>
<p>Placing an accent above a glyph is surprisingly tricky. Centered accents (like
grave, acute, etc.) should not really be placed in the exact center of the
glyph. For instance when placing an acute accent on top of an “a” the accent
should actually go above the highest part of the “a” which is almost but not
quite in the center of the glyph. And when placing an acute on top of a “k” (a
rare combination, but still used) the accent is centered on the stem of the “k”.
Greek accents are even more baroque. FontForge knows many oddities of accent
placement, but it will never know all of them (some letters have multiple forms
depending on the font, or perhaps on the humidity and phase of the moon).</p>

<p>And how accents are centered depends on the accents themselves. Usually
FontForge will try to center an accent so that the accent’s center is over the
base glyph’s “center”. But that doesn’t always work either. The grave and acute
accents are usually (but not always) centered only on the bottom part of the
glyph.</p>

<p>FontForge gives you a minuscule amount of control over where it puts accents.
There are two preference items you can set
(<a class="reference internal" href="../ui/menus/filemenu.html#filemenu-prefs"><span class="std std-ref">File-&gt;Preferences</span></a>)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>AccentOffsetPercent – This allows you to control the amount of space between
the top of the letter and the bottom of the accent (or the bottom of the letter
and the top of the accent for accents that sink under their letters). This is
expressed as a percentage of the em size and defaults to 6%. (In some cases
there will be a little bit more space above the accent than that. All the
accents from all the lower case letters should be at the same height, but the
letter “o” is usually slightly higher than the letter “u”. So all the lower case
accents will be placed at the appropriate height for “o”, even those over “u”. A
similar trick is done for upper case letters).</p></li>
<li><p>AcuteCenterBottom – This controls whether acute and grave (and double acute and
grave) accents are centered on the entire glyph, or just on the bottom.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>So FontForge is going to do something wrong. There are just too many areas
where I am ignorant or my taste doesn’t match yours or the program has a bug.
I strongly recommend that you examine all your accented glyphs after building
them and be prepared to adjust things.</p>
</div>
<p>The algorithms take some account of the italicangle, but when working on an
italic (or oblique) font FontForge is even more likely to do something you don’t
like.</p>
<p>If all else fails you can build your own accented glyphs with
<a class="reference internal" href="../ui/menus/editmenu.html#editmenu-reference"><span class="std std-ref">Edit-&gt;Copy Reference</span></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="../ui/menus/editmenu.html#editmenu-paste"><span class="std std-ref">Edit-&gt;Paste</span></a></p>
