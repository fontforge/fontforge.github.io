<h1><span class="section-number">9. </span>Conditional Features<a class="headerlink" href="#conditional-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>OpenType and Apple fonts both provide contextual features. These are features
which only take place in a given context and are essential for typesetting Indic
and Arabic scripts. In OpenType a context is specified by a set of patterns that
are tested against the glyph stream of a document. If a pattern matches then any
substitutions it defines will be applied. In an Apple font, the context is
specified by a state machine – a mini program which parses and transforms the
glyph stream.</p>
<p>Conditional features may involve substitutions, ligatures or kerning (and some
more obscure behaviors). First I shall provide an example of a contextual
substitution, later of <a class="reference internal" href="#editexample6-5-greek"><span class="std std-ref">contextual ligatures</span></a>.</p>
<img alt="../_images/bed-script.png" class="align-right" src="../_images/bed-script.png" />
<p>Instead of an Indic or Arabic example, let us take something I’m more familiar
with, the problem of typesetting a latin script font where the letters “b,” “o,”
“v” and “w” join their following letter near the x-height, while all other
letters join near the baseline. Thus we need two variants for each glyph, one
that joins (on the left) at the baseline (the default variant) and one which
joins at the x-height. Let us call this second set of letters the “high” letters
and name them “a.high,” “b.high” and so forth.</p>
<div class="section" id="opentype-example">
<h2><span class="section-number">9.1. </span>OpenType Example<a class="headerlink" href="#opentype-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>The following example may not work! The font tables produced by it are all
correct, but early implementations of OpenType did not support decided the
“Contextual Alternative” (‘calt’) feature for the latin script.</p>
<p>Why do I provide an example which might not work? It’s the best I can do. If
I knew enough about Indic or Arabic typesetting I would provide an example
for those scripts. But I don’t. The procedures are the same. If you follow
them for some other scripts they will work.</p>
<p>As time has gone on ‘calt’ has been supported by more applications for latn
and this warning is no longer as applicable as it once was.</p>
</div>
<p>We divide the set of possible glyphs into three classes: the letters “bovw”, all
other letters, and all other glyphs. We need to create two patterns, the first
will match a glyph in the “bovw” class followed by another glyph in the “bovw”
class, while the second will match a glyph in the “bovw” class followed by any
other letter. If either of these matches the second glyph should be transformed
into its high variant.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>[bovw] [bovw] =&gt; Apply a substitution to second letter</p></li>
<li><p>[bovw] &lt;any other letter&gt; =&gt; Apply a substitution to the second letter</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(You might wonder why I don’t just have a class of all letters and use one rule
instead of two? Because in this case all my classes must be disjoint, I mayn’t
have one glyph appearing in two classes).</p>
<p>The first thing we must do is create a simple substitution mapping each low
letter to its high variant. This is a “Simple Substitution” lookup, but it will
not be attached to any feature, instead it will be invoked by a contextual
lookup. Let us call this lookup “high”. We must (of course) create a subtable to
go with our lookup, and we can use the [Default with Suffix:] button to fill it
up with the high variants.</p>
<p>The tricky part is defining the context. This is done by defining yet another
lookup, a contextual chaining lookup which should be associated with a ‘calt’
feature. And of course we want an associated subtable). This will pop up a
series of dialogs to edit a contextual subtable</p>
<img alt="../_images/contextchain-format.png" class="align-left" src="../_images/contextchain-format.png" />
<p>The first dialog allows you to specify the overall format of the substitution.
We want a class based system – we’ve already mentioned what the glyph classes
will be.</p>
<img alt="../_images/contextchain-simpleclasses.png" class="align-right" src="../_images/contextchain-simpleclasses.png" />
<p>The next dialog finally shows something interesting. At the top is a pattern to
match and substitutions that will be applied if the string matches. Underneath
that are the glyph classes that this substitution uses. A contextual chaining
dialog divides the glyph stream into three sections: those glyphs before the
current glyph (these are called backtracking glyphs), the current glyph(s)
itself (themselves), which may have simple substitutions applied to them, and
finally glyphs after the current glyph (these are called lookahead glyphs).</p>
<p>Each category of glyphs may divide glyphs into a different set of classes, but
in this example we use the same classes for all categories (this makes it easier
to convert the substitution to Apple’s format). The first line (in the “Matching
rules” field) should be read thus: If a backtracking glyph (the glyph before the
current one) in class “high-after” is followed by the current glyph in class
“letter”, then that letter in the match string (that is the current glyph)
should have simple substitution “To-TopJoin” applied to it.</p>
<p>If you look at the glyph class definitions you will see that class “high-afters”
includes those glyphs which must be followed by a high variant, so this seems
reasonable.</p>
<p>Now there should be a second line which would look like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;high-after</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">high-after</span> <span class="pre">&#64;&lt;To-TopJoin&gt;</span> <span class="pre">|&quot;</span></code> to handle the second case
mentioned above. Unfortunately that doesn’t seem to work. The OpenType spec
allows for it, but implementations of OpenType don’t seem to support it. Instead
that line must be in a separate sub-table in the same lookup.</p>
<p>To edit a glyph class simply click on it and type. To create a new one press the
&lt;New&gt; button (at the bottom of the list). You can also click on the little box
thingy off on the right. This produces another dialog showing a font view. You
can select glyphs in the font view if that is easier than remembering their
names.</p>
<p>You may edit a pattern in the obvious way. As you enter glyph names they will be
auto completed for you. There are two buttons down at the bottom of the pattern
list, one to start a new section (go from back tracking to active, or from
active to lookahead), and one to add a new lookup reference.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p><strong>A warning about contextual behavior:</strong> Not all software supports them. And
even more confusing software may support them for some scripts and not for
others.</p>

<div class="section" id="apple-advanced-typography">
<span id="editexample6-5-apple"></span><h2><span class="section-number">9.2. </span>Apple advanced typography<a class="headerlink" href="#apple-advanced-typography" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Apple specifies a context with a finite state machine, which is essentially a
tiny program that looks at the glyph stream and decides what substitutions to
apply. Each state machine has a set of glyph class definitions (just as in the
OpenType example), and a set of states. The process begins in state 0 at the
start of the glyph stream. The computer determines what class the current glyph
is in and then looks at the current state to see how it will behave when given
input from that class. The behavior includes the ability to change to a
different state, advancing the input to the next glyph, applying a substitution
to either the current glyph or a previous one (the “marked” glyph).</p>
<img alt="../_images/sm-picture.png" class="align-right" src="../_images/sm-picture.png" />
<p>Using the same example of a latin script font… We again need a simple
substitution to convert each letter into its high alternate. The process is the
same as it was for OpenType, and indeed we can use the same substitution. Again
we divide the glyphs into three classes (Apple gives us some extra classes
whether we want them or no, but conceptually we use the same three classes as in
the OpenType example). We want a state machine with two states (again Apple
gives us an extra state for free, but we shall ignore that), one is the start
state (the base state – where nothing changes), and the other is the state
where we’ve just read a glyph from the “bovw” class.</p>
<img alt="../_images/asm1.png" class="align-left" src="../_images/asm1.png" />
<p>Apple Advanced Typography does not quite fit into the OpentType concepts of
lookups and features, but it is close enough that I sort of force it to. So once
again we create a GSUB lookup. This time the lookup type is “Mac Contextual
State Machine”, and the feature is actually a mac feature/setting, two numbers.
When we create a new subtable of this type we get a state machine dialog, as
shown below.</p>
<img alt="../_images/asm2.png" class="align-right" src="../_images/asm2.png" />
<p>At the top of the dialog we see a set of class definitions, and at the bottom is
a representation of the state machine itself.</p>
<img alt="../_images/asm3.png" class="align-left" src="../_images/asm3.png" />
<p>Double clicking on a class brings up a dialog similar to that used in OpenType</p>
<img alt="../_images/asm4.png" class="align-right" src="../_images/asm4.png" />
<p>Clicking on a transition in the state machine (there is a transition for each
state / class combination) produces a transition dialog. This controls how the
state machine behaves when it is in a given state and receives a glyph in a
given class. In this example it is in state 2 (which means it has already read a
“bovw” glyph), and it has received a glyph in class 4 (which is another “bovw”
glyph). In this case the next state will be state 2 again (we will have just
read a new “bovw” glyph), read another glyph and apply the “high” substitution
to the current glyph.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the dialog are a series of buttons that allow you to navigate
through the transitions of the state machine.</p>
<p>Pressing [OK] many times will extract you from this chain of dialogs and add a
new state machine to your font.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="opentype-greek-ligatures">
<span id="editexample6-5-greek"></span><h2><span class="section-number">9.3. </span>OpenType, Greek ligatures<a class="headerlink" href="#opentype-greek-ligatures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Greek has a character (U+03D7) which is equivalent to the Latin ampersand. Just
as the ampersand is (originally) a ligature of “E” and “t”, so U+03D7 is a
ligature of “kappa” and “iota”. However this ligature should only be used if
“kappa” and “iota” make up a word unto themselves, it should not be used for
more normal occurances of the two within a longer word.</p>
<img alt="../_images/kappa_iota-lookup.png" class="align-right" src="../_images/kappa_iota-lookup.png" />
<p>So the first thing to do is create the ligature itself. Add the glyph for
U+03D7, and then create a ligature lookup and subtable (with
<a class="reference internal" href="../ui/dialogs/fontinfo.html#fontinfo-lookups"><span class="std std-ref">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Lookups)</span></a> to bind U+03D7 to be a
ligature of “kappa” and “iota”. This lookup will never be used directly – only
under the control of another, a conditional feature – so we don’t give it a
feature tag.</p>
<img alt="../_images/kappa_iota-subtable.png" src="../_images/kappa_iota-subtable.png" />
<p>Next the conditional bit.</p>
<p>I’m going to use the notation &lt;letters&gt; to represent a class consisting of all
greek letters.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>&lt;letters&gt; kappa iota =&gt; no substitution</p></li>
<li><p>kappa iota &lt;letters&gt; =&gt; no substitution</p></li>
<li><p>kappa iota =&gt; apply the ligature “WORD”</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="small">(Now as I read the standard all these rules could be put into one subtable, and the font validation tools I have agree with me – but the layout engines do not. The layout engines seem to insist that each rule live in its own subtable. This is inconvenient (the classes must be defined in each subtable) but it seems to work.)</span></p>
<p>These rules will be executed in order, and the first one that matches the input
text will be the (one and only) rule applied. Consider these three strings,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\kappa\iota\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa\iota\theta\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\kappa\iota\theta\)</span>
all contain kappa and iota but each contains more letters around them, so none
should be replaced by the ligature.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The first string, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\kappa\iota\)</span>, will match the first rule above (it
contains letters before the kappa iota sequence) and no substitution will be done.
It also matches the third rule, but we never get that far.</p></li>
<li><p>The second string, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa\iota\theta\)</span>, will match the second rule above
(it contains letters after the sequence) and again no substitution will be done.
It would match the third rule, but we stop with the first match.</p></li>
<li><p>The third string, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\kappa\iota\theta\)</span>, matches all the rules, but
since the search stops at the first match, only the first rule will be applied,
and no substitution will be done.</p></li>
<li><p>The string, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\_\kappa\iota\_\)</span>, matches neither of the first two rules
but does match the last, so here the ligature will be formed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You might wonder why I don’t just have one rule</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>&lt;any non-letter&gt; kappa iota &lt;any non-letter&gt; =&gt; apply our ligature</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It seems much simpler.</p>
<p>Well there’s one main reason:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>This does not work if the kappa is at the beginning of the input stream (it will
not be preceded by any glyphs, but might still need replacing), or iota at the
end.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now how do we convert these rules into a contextual lookup?</p>
<img alt="../_images/kappa_iota-context.png" class="align-left" src="../_images/kappa_iota-context.png" />
<p>We use <a class="reference internal" href="../ui/dialogs/lookups.html"><span class="doc">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Lookups-&gt;Add Lookup</span></a> to
create a new contextual chaining lookup. This is the top level lookup and should
be bound to a feature tag in the Greek script.</p>
<p>We have three rules, each rule lives in its own subtable, so we will create
three subtables, one for each. The order in which these subtables n the Lookups
pane is important because that is the order in which the rules they contain will
be executed. We must insure that that final rule which actually invokes the
ligature is the last one executed (and the last one in the list).</p>
<p class="rubric">Steps</p>
<img alt="../_images/hligbyclasses.png" src="../_images/hligbyclasses.png" />
<p>Since we are planning on using the class of all greek letters we will want to
use a class format for this feature. Then we press the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Next&gt;]</span></code> button.</p>
<img alt="../_images/emptyhlig.png" src="../_images/emptyhlig.png" />
<p>The main match will be on the letters kappa and iota in all three rules, so
we need one class for each of them. So in the Match Classes area we press the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[New]</span></code> button…</p>
<img alt="../_images/hligkappaclass.png" src="../_images/hligkappaclass.png" />
<p>And type in the word “kappa” and press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Next&gt;]</span></code></p>
<img alt="../_images/hligkappa.png" src="../_images/hligkappa.png" />
<p>Now we have a class containing the single glyph “kappa”. We want to do the
same thing for “iota” so we press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[New]</span></code> again.</p>
<img alt="../_images/hligiotaclass.png" src="../_images/hligiotaclass.png" />
<p>Again type in “iota” and press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Next&gt;]</span></code></p>
<img alt="../_images/hligkappaiota.png" src="../_images/hligkappaiota.png" />
<p>Now we have all the classes we need here. We still need to create classes for
the lookahead and backtrack. We only need one class for these groups and that
class will consist of all greek letters.</p>
<img alt="../_images/hligback.png" src="../_images/hligback.png" />
<p>The check box <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[*]</span> <span class="pre">Same</span> <span class="pre">as</span> <span class="pre">Match</span> <span class="pre">Classes</span></code> is set, but we don’t want that,
we want our own classes here. So uncheck it.</p>
<img alt="../_images/hligbacknomatch.png" src="../_images/hligbacknomatch.png" />
<p>Now the buttons become active and we can create a new class by pressing
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[New]</span></code></p>
<img alt="../_images/allgreek.png" src="../_images/allgreek.png" />
<p>Now you could go back to the font view and select all of the greek letters,
and then press the [Set From Font] button in the class dialog.</p>
<img alt="../_images/hliggreekclass.png" src="../_images/hliggreekclass.png" />
<p>But in this case the class we are interested in (all the greek letters) is
built it, and you can select it from the Standard Class pulldown list
(Letters in script(s)) Then press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Next&gt;]</span></code>.</p>
<div class="flex-container">
<div class="flex-row">
<div class="flex-col">
<img alt="../_images/hliggreekback.png" src="../_images/hliggreekback.png" />
</div>
<div class="flex-col">
<img alt="../_images/hliggreekahead.png" src="../_images/hliggreekahead.png" />
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then go through the same process for the look ahead classes (adding one class
which consists of all the greek letters.</p>
<img alt="../_images/hlignewrule.png" src="../_images/hlignewrule.png" />
<p>Now we have all our classes defined and are finally ready to create the
patterns for our rules. So underneath “List of lists of class numbers” press
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[New]</span></code> button.</p>
<img alt="../_images/hligbackrule.png" src="../_images/hligbackrule.png" />
<p>The first rule begins with all the greek letters in the backtrack area, so
click on the “Backtrack” tab, and then press on the class consisting of all
the greek letters. This puts the class number into the pattern area (the List
of class numbers)</p>
<img alt="../_images/hligrule.png" src="../_images/hligrule.png" />
<p>In the match area we want to match kappa and then iota, so click on the Match
tab, and then on the entries for “kappa” and “iota”.</p>
<p>This rule has no substitutions, so leave the bottom area blank and press
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Next&gt;]</span></code>.</p>
<img alt="../_images/hligbackruledone.png" src="../_images/hligbackruledone.png" />
<p>We are done with the first rule. It says:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The previous character should match class 1 of the backtrack classes (and
that class contains all greek letters, which is what we want)</p></li>
<li><p>The current character should match class 1 of the match classes (and that
class contains “kappa”)</p></li>
<li><p>The next character should match class 2 of the match classes (which is iota)</p></li>
<li><p>And if the match is successful, do absolutely nothing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve got two more rules though, so press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[OK]</span></code> and then
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Add</span> <span class="pre">Subtable]</span></code>. Then go through the process of adding all the classes,
and then add the match string for this rule.</p>
<img alt="../_images/hligaheadruledone.png" src="../_images/hligaheadruledone.png" />
<p>We are done with the second rule. It says:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The current character should match class 1 of the match classes (and that
class contains “kappa”)</p></li>
<li><p>The next character should match class 2 of the match classes (which is iota)</p></li>
<li><p>The character after that should match class 1 of the lookahead classes (and
that class contains all the greek letters)</p></li>
<li><p>And if the match is successful, do absolutely nothing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[OK]</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Add</span> <span class="pre">Subtable]</span></code> for the final rule.</p>
<img alt="../_images/hligrule.png" src="../_images/hligrule.png" />
<p>This rule does have substitutions – we want to take the two characters and
convert them into a ligature. So Press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[New]</span></code> under the sequence position
list, we want to start at the first character (sequence position 0) and apply
the ligature we called “WORD”:</p>
<img alt="../_images/hligseqdlg.png" src="../_images/hligseqdlg.png" />
<p>So if anything doesn’t match the first two rules, and does contain a kappa
followed by an iota, it must be a two letter stand-alone greek word. And we
want to apply our ligature to it.</p>
<img alt="../_images/hligallrulesdone.png" src="../_images/hligallrulesdone.png" />
<p>Now we are done. Press a series of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[OK]</span></code>s until all the dialogs have been
accepted.</p>
<img alt="../_images/kappaiota-lookups.png" src="../_images/kappaiota-lookups.png" />
<p>Once you have created your lookups you may test the result in the
<a class="reference internal" href="../ui/mainviews/metricsview.html"><span class="doc">metrics view</span></a>.</p>
