Homepage
========

This should be as to-the-point and clearly designed as possible, I think it needs to have:

- Brief project description
- Maintainers
- License (but just a link to a TXT)
- Mailing list
- links to information that someone might be looking for right away

The links to download, install, and documentation will already be prominant as a part of the navigation. But we might want to include a link to the python-scripting documentation directly. ALSO: Should we keep a direct download link right on the main page?
